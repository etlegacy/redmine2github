    "description": "In Legacy players always spawn with 100% charge-bar. This enables ability spam, which especially in competitive play is not desired.\r\nPlayers should be rewarded for timely and thought-through use of abilities rather than encouraging perma-arty.\r\n\r\nIn ETPro this is handled by b_stickycharge. (Client's powerbar refills completely (0) or gradually after suicide (1)/ any death (2).)\r\n\r\nThe discussion in Discord resulted in the general desire for a gradual recharge after any death. No pause during respawn queue, no pause during use of different class.\r\nTo avoid bloating of the codebase, we could think about simply implementing this as the default behaviour in legacy mod, without using an additional cvar.",
