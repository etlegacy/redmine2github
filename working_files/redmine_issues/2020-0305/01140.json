On the one hand players want better visual adds (see r2) and on the other hand we are dropping effects by default now?\r\n\r\nWe are nearly in 2019 and there is no compare to computers when the game was born - from performance perspective we don't have disable such features. The impact on fps when these are disabled is poor. Maybe 'pro' players realy don't want to see blood, muzzle and co but these players are using their own configs anyway. I've seen configs where the sky is disabled .. :0 so where to stop disabling such stuff ?! :)\r\n \r\nI would rather add a config or adjust existing configs (preset_high/preset_normal etc). ",

I was more thinking about making the game plug'n'play, rather than optimizing config for competition or performance.",
