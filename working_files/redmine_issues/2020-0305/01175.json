    "description": "The field of view (fov) has been adjusted in Legacy so the default value is always \"natural\" by default, regardless of actual the resolution. This is done by using the \"horizontal FOV formula\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view_in_video_games\r\n\r\nThere are still a few fov adjustment left to do in the code though. These value have been designed for the 4/3 screen era, and are not adequate when used with nowadays 16/9 screens.\r\nThe competition configs we ship have a range check from [90, 120]. The modern equivalent would be [73.74, 104.82]. Currently [90,120] on Legacy would be [106.26, 133.27] in other mods, so our values are\"shifted\" and need to be fixed.\r\n\r\nA few notes:\r\n* MGs and Tanks use a specific \"zoomed\" fov of 55 and 75, respectively, and are properly adjusted automatically too.\r\n* Maximum fov value is forced to 160, while  the minimum fov is forced to 90. We might want to lower this value to allow for quick zoom when shooting?\r\n\r\nIn attachment a few screenshots for fov comparison between Legacy and other mods. Legacy fov 90 is the equivalent of other mod fov 106.",
