Currently it is possible to set the time of the match by the admin, but once it started, it can not be altered.\r\n\r\nThe request is to allow the referee to set exactly how much time left during the match (extending or shortening it) and ordinary players to call votes for extending/shortening by prdefined X minutes ( I suggest X=5 minutes).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
