    "description": "I just played 2.70rc1 (with NQ 1.2.9-b6) and had the problem that input was not working correctly in the chat/result screen at the end of a game.\r\nMouse movement was working, but I wasn't able to click any buttons (Quick Chat, Ready, More). The only key that seemed to be working was the ESC button, which correctly showed the menu, but I couldn't type anything into the chat input line.\r\nUnfortunately I can't reproduce it. It works fine after most games, but this was now at least the second time I noticed this bug.",
