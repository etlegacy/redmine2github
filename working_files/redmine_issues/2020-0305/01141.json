A good use for it, is to help protect your rcon, ref, semiadmin etc passwords, just in case a trusted member or even yourself forget to put the / (slash) before said passwords when signing in. Should you wish to use it, just list all the passwords/forbidden words leaving a space between each word (i.e. set b_cursefilter \"pass1 pass2 swear1 swear2 etc\"), default \"\", disabled.\r\n\r\n_cursefilteraction\tControls what action to take with filtered words, default 3...... 0 = do nothing (not a wise choice if your wishing to filter certain words out lol), 1 = silently filter the messages (it will still appear to the player as though his/her message was sent), 2 = censor (e.g. \"hey, you are a *******\"), 3 = filter the message (it isn't displayed to anybody).",
