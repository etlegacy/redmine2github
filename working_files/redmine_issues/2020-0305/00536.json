I cannot test this at the moment, but from what I see in source:etmain/ui/huds.hud#L22 it's already possible to toggle visibility of HUD elements, so we can just extend it to switch styles as well.

This is actually a great way to handle information.\r\n\r\nHowever, I've seen the way it works is simpler than I'd like it to be:\r\n* it only displays the indicator when the enemy has the obj,  not teammates;\r\n* it only displays it when the enemy is carrying the obj, but doesn't indicate when the obj has been dropped and need to be recovered.\r\n\r\nKnowing when the obj has been dropped but has not been recoevered is quite important, since it means the work to secure it is not yet finished.\r\nWith the way I've implemented the feature, we can handle these information quite easily. Here is a new proposal:\r\n\r\n* Display team flags if allies/enemy have the obj;\r\n* Use of colors to see its status: Green when you or your teammate have the obj, Red when the enemy has the obj, and yellow when the obj has been dropped but nobody has it.\r\nIn case of multi obj maps (like goldrush), the red color takes priority over yellow, and yellow takes priority over green.\r\nIn case of mulit obj that both team can have (like baserace)... I guess split icon with independent color on each side?",

However, the only way to check if the objective has been taken by a teammate or the enemy team is to check the scoreboard or/and refers to the audio announcement. Showing a visual indicator at all time might improve objective gameplay.\r\n\r\nSilent's implementation is proposed as follow:\r\n- show a green icon when you are carrying the objective (as currently done)\r\n- show a blue icon when a teammate carry the objective\r\n- show a red icon when an enemy carry the objective\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the best implementation, but this might be a good start. Showing a half-red/half-blue icon when both team carry the obj might be useful too (baserace, darji, ..).",
