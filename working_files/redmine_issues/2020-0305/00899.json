    "subject": "Please provide a build option to use the system library for minizip",
    "description": "The game engine embeds the minizip library without an option to use the system library on Unix systems. I think ETLBuildClient.cmake should be updated to use pkg-config for finding such a system version of minizip. The following patch works for me and was tested on a recent Debian Sid system. \r\n\r\nPlease also consider to remove the embedded copy of minizip and zlib because both libraries are very common. This reduces the maintenance work for downstream distributions in case of security vulnerabilities and it reduces code duplication in general. See also Debian's upstream guide for other good practices.\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.debian.org/UpstreamGuide#No_inclusion_of_third_party_code",
