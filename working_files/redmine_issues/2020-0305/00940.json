Just google for \"WS.Reputation.1 NSIS\" and you'll see that this is a very common issue.\r\n\r\nSymantec uses a \"reputation\" based algorithm, in addition to the heuristic analysis. Of course, NSIS being very popular, free and easy to use it is most probably used by many malware out there.\r\nUnfortunately, nothing we can do :(",
