People are so busy chatting, seeing their stats and 50 sec passes out, pretty fast. Increasing intermission doesn't solve the issue, either. We run banners specially during intermission, to raise the awareness. May be a in-build intermission banner would help. IMO, LUA option works fine as well. \r\n\r\nOne option if you guys can fix it i.e. players can vote /reconnect vote again and pump up the votes for 1 map. If that can be resolved, it would be great. I haven't tried similar behavior on ETL mod yet but I believe it exist in various other mods. Thanks!\r\n\r\n",

We run banners specially during intermission, to raise the awareness. May be a in-build intermission banner would help. IMO, LUA option works fine as well. \r\n\r\nWell, if you want to force people to vote, there is the g_mapvoteflag 2 which won't end intermission unless some percentage of players have voted (g_intermissionReadyPercent ). It's a double edge sword though, as if you put it to 100% some players will cause the next map to be delayed by not voting in time, or block it by not voting at all.\r\n\r\nEventually, you can't really force people to vote - and neither should we force them to do so. It's more about giving them the opportunity to influence the choice of the next map, but many players are just happy to go with the flow, regardless of the chosen map.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do, however, is to streamline the process. Make it less clickly to choose a map, maybe add some colour on buttons when the player hasn't voted yet, add some sort of warning on the upper counter, etc.\r\n\r\n> One option if you guys can fix it i.e. players can vote /reconnect vote again and pump up the votes for 1 map.

We'll have a look into this. Tracking in #1228.\r\n",
