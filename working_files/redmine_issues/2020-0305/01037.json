(confirmed by me also)\r\n- They all look at the sky. (confirmed by me also)\r\n- They cannot run  (not confirmed by me yet)\r\n\r\nThe obvious: This would mean that by typing in chat, you can affect your teammates (non bot) movement and would make this bug an exploit. \r\n\r\nI only tested this addendum on a Linux 64 bit client with another linux 64 bit client. Didn't have time to test on Windows, Mac or 32bit Linux but I assume this affects all platforms. Jakbu tested on Windows.\r\n\r\nAlso. In this bug system, you should add an option \"All platforms\" to the OS section.\r\n\r\nTom",
