    "description": "Currently only \"func_invsible_user\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=func_invisible_user support \"activate <axis|allies>\".\r\nWith this you can set different activation sequences per team for each trigger. This is quite a handy feature as it can save trigger blocks inside an entity which are limited to 196. (Sounds a lot, but for escortables are actually quite restrictive). It can also save the need for having one trigger (eg trigger_multiple) for either team.\r\n\r\nFor example the tug in Railgun. There are two trigger_multiples. One of which is axis_only and the other one is allies_only. They obviously do the same, but move the tug into opposite directions. This could be handled with one trigger easily.\r\n\r\nThat functionality is actually already listed (falsely) on Chruker's \"list\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/scripting_reference.php#complete_list\r\n\r\nObviously, maps with that will break compatibility, but like with all of these requests, it's the responsibility of the mapper to decide. We should however, provide the functionality in my opinion.",
