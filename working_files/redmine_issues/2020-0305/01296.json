    "description": "It's very rare bug, but still happens. Upon receiving specific damage amount, the tank becomes not escortable nor it is damaged (although it shows 0 hp). Engies can't fix it, requires enemy to cause additional damage to the tank - to make it fully damaged, or should wait for about half a minute before it gets damaged by itself. It happens in etpro, but i am not entirely sure it's reproducible in legacy yet.\r\nhttps://clips.twitch.tv/LovelyKindNoodleCoolStoryBro",
