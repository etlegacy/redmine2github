In this case the list of possible resolutions seems to be a default that only includes 4:3 resolutions and one \"wide screen\" resolution (as far as I remember). I don't remember exactly but don't think 16:9 nor 16:10 resolutions were in the list.\r\n\r\nThe second is that when I selected one of the bigger resolutions, not supported by the driver/monitor, ETL crashed as described before.\r\n\r\nAfter restarting the machine and starting with a clean ~/.etlwolf folder the problem went away and I now have the full list of supported resolutions and no crashes so far.\r\nI remember having etl_bin_v2.71rc1.pk3 in my profile folder, don't know if this could also interfere with the detection.\r\n\r\nPS: Sorry for the late reply, I didn't get any notification of reply and only came back to check the ticket today.",
