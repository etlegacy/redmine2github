Computing accuracy with shots/hits works only for bullet weapons. At the moment, the best accuracy award is almost always constantly given to the flamethrower.\r\n\r\nNote I don't want to change the hits stats, only compute accuracy in a more realistic way.\r\n\r\n> As a side question, are the gibbing shots considered as non-hit?\r\n\r\nGibbing currently doesn't take either shots nor hits into account.. which means the number of \"shots\" is also always wrong (see #478). This ticket is a first step to fix that other issue.",

If possible, accuracy should be computed as the number of shots that actually hit a target (boolean only).\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n* actually: 2 shots (1 misses, 1 hits 3 time) = accuracy 150%.\r\n* real accuracy: 2 shots, (1 misses, 1 hits 3 time) = accuracy 50%\r\n\r\nAlso get rid of the many hacks that cap accuracy at 100% through the code (see #478 for commits list).",
