    "subject": "Chargebar status is hard to see",
    "description": "The chargebar turns red when the selected weapon cannot be used, but that is somewhat hard to see when the charge is low due to the applied gradient when the charge is low. Make the chargebar clearer to see by removing that gradient, so we'd only have a single color when the chargebar is not entirely full (and maybe use another color when it's full). Maybe \"red\" (can't use), yellow (charging), white (full).",
