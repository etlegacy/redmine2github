I don't know what the purpose of trying to catch the signals are if all that happens as a result is the game immediately shuts down. What is gained? Crashing hard at least gives useful information in the form of a *real* crash log.\r\n\r\nHad this parachute not been installed, we'd have real crash reports and could actually see the real problem and really know if it was fixed by something or not.",
