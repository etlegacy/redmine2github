They shouldn't be allowed in the first place anyway. The official WolfET installer has been updated a long time ago to ship with an etkey functionality, so this shouldn't be an issue.",

            "notes": "The issue seems related to game session, which has not been reset for one player correctly (thus not related to SR code directly). Player \"CHICKEN NUGGET\" got a time played (as axis) way too high, which has an impact on the rating weight (map was 9 vs 10, but with that weight the algo computed it a bit like 25 vs 10). Since Axis team lost, all players in that team got their rating kicked big time, since such a strength difference would be highly unexpected.\r\nI however don't really understand why players on the Allies team got their rating lowered. Comparing WolfAdmin database (provided by TM admins) revealed that several players seemingly had no guid - and unlike PB code, our code doesn't check for GUID collision. One single \"empty guid\" account was thus shared between players of both side, but I'm not sure how this impacted Allies team global score.\r\n\r\nMy best guess at this time is that something went wrong while connecting (a player not disconnected fully, lag, ...), which didn't reset or unexpectedly recovered old session data. Empty or unknown guid aren now not accepted anymore, and some initialization failsafe for play time were also added (in case of new connection). We'll see how if that improves the situation over time.\r\n\r\nEdit: Interestingly, session data for time played/deaths/kills for that player were not reset, but damage given/received and score seems to have been reset correctly at the match start. Investigate.",

Some data were still available from last map - including sess.time_axis/allies used by SR. We were able to reproduce the issue to get a bigger SR update expected, and this should now be fixed.\r\n\r\nWe couldn't reproduce the exact behaviour above (all data of all or most players getting down), but the above case is quite an edge case due to the very short duration of the map, following a long one. Since SR isn't quite linear internally, it is hard to predict what would exactly happen in these edge cases. Some logging have been added server side to monitor future behaviour (as part as #403) and bug tracking, so I'll consider this particular ticket fully resolved.\r\n\r\n",
