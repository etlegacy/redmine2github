The other thing is that mid server can become a lag fest with such hitboxes even if running on Core i7 machine...\r\n\r\nI'd only like to suggest to just slightly adjust original/ETPro hitboxes, what I' thinking about is something like this:\r\n\r\n!http://obrazki.elektroda.pl/9863735000_1368266180.png!\r\n\r\nBodybox ending at the shoulders level instead of the top of the head, it is a big change already but worth implementing in my opinion so:\r\n1.

    "description": "The current system of hit detection is flawed and outdated in many ways, and as computers have gotten a lot quicker after the cold war the more complex calculation needed for detection is no longer a problem.\r\n\r\nI think we should go with the common idea of bounding box which has the hit boxes inside of it.\r\nWe can use the animation skeleton to bind hit boxes more accurately to the model.\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Hitbox",
