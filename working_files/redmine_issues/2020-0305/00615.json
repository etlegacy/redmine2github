When you go near the jeep it will give an electricity sound, so loud that you won't sleep for the rest of the night. Also when the jeep moves, it makes the sound of capturing the flag. So sound issues are real and SERIOUS. Thank God I'm still alive after that \"screamer\"...\r\n\r\n-*S",

After \"Fight!\" as Allies there comes this: \"WARNING: CG_EntityEvent() cannot play EV_GLOBAL_SOUND sound ''\r\n2. As Allies you can't hear anything when trying to open Axis door near the old city wall\r\n3. When Axis opens the door, the sound is unsynched with the actual animation\r\n4. Announcer sounds are wrong for each team. Allies announcer says Axis side announcements like defend the old city wall and so on\r\n5. WARNING: CG_EntityEvent() cannot play EV_GLOBAL_CLIENT_SOUND sound '' when taking the flag as Axis first\r\n6. Weird explosion sounds when capturing the flag\r\n\r\nThe list might go on.
