This allows walking through some patches (like cylinders) along axial directions.\r\n\r\nThe issues was reported by Tobias Kuehnhammer for Spearmint (ioq3 with some ET changes). I've confirmed the issues exists in ET:Legacy. As far as I can tell the change was to optimize loading patches (but it finds some false-positives). I fixed it by reverting back to Q3/RTCW code (which works in ETL too): https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/commit/205b56b9f3c7f0df27f9631ff9449b8df1435567\r\n\r\nTo load the Q3 map (mentioned below) in ET:Legacy, allow loading BSP version 46 in cm_load.c and tr_bsp.c. You might want to test the map in Q3 first to get feel for the map / easier to follow diections to find the cylinders.\r\n\r\nHOW TO REPRODUCE (written by Tobias Kuehnhammer, references to Spearmint replaced with ETL):\r\n\r\n1. If you haven't it on your HDD, please download this map: http://lvlworld.com/download/Rainy%20Day\r\n   The map is called 'ct3tourney2' (Rainy Day)\r\n\r\n2. Put the ct3tourney2.pk3 into your ETL game directory and start this map with /devmap ct3tourney2\r\n\r\n3. This map has no 'initial spawnpoint' so you will spawn anywhere and we have to navigate through the level to find the location:\r\n   a. Walk around through the level. We have to find the 'Red Armor'! If you find the 'GL' or 'RL', you are very close to the 'Red Armor'\r\n      Screenshot A shows where the 'Red Armor' is located.\r\n\r\n   b. Pick up the 'Red Armor' but dont't move any further. Turn around until you see two cylinders in front of a wall.\r\n      Screenshot B shows these two cylinders / kind of pipes. They are very near next to you, on the same floor height.\r\n\r\n   c. Walk to these cylinders. In ioquake3 you can't walk inside/through these cylinders. In ETL you can!\r\n      If it doesn't happen at the first time. Try to enter them from another side/angle. Sometimes you can walk only through one cylinder, sometimes you can walk trough both.\r\n      Sometimes you can walk in and out and sometimes you will get caught! Try to stop movement and turn your view, it seems more likely that it is easier to get caught when looking around!\r\n      Screenshot C shows a player inside these two cylinders.\r\n\r\n4. Maybe this will help. I decompiled the map and made a screenshot of the specific brushwork.\r\n   Screenshot D shows the cylinders in Radiant editor. There is no clip brush around the meshes. They are 'worldspawn' brushes, not 'func_group' entities.\r\n",
