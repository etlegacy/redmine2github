No chargebar, no knowledge, etc. \r\nIf a medic is low on health and spent all his charge on healing others, it is a viable and necessary choice of the other medic to heal him.\r\nIf an engi is standing on a landmine and doesn't know what to do, the second engi that comes to defuse it is also rewarded XP, although the first one should've known better.\r\n\r\nI realize that this is a bit getting lost in semantics and I do admit my reasoning is mostly about the plain principle of consistency.
