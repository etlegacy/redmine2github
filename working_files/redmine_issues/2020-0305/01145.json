            "notes": "This feature was really bugged. The timer itself didn't work correctly: it would wait half the value before displaying a warning then starting the countdown (f.e. if inactivity is set to 600, it would wait 5 minutes before starting the 10 minutes countdown). The value displayed in the warning messages was also quite erractic.\r\n\r\nI reworked the function completely and it should behave correctly now. There is a single warning at 30 sec before drop, then a countdown during the last 10 sec. There is no need to display more messages, as the player is likely afk.\r\n\r\nThis function should eventually be moved to WA, see #932.",
