    "description": "The ALT+TAB shortcut standardly minimizes the game on Windows (on Linux i didn't test yet). Two issues, after minimize (from fullscreen mode) and then maximize again:\r\n\r\na) the game still thinks tab key is held down (tab menu gets displayed without tab key pressed)\r\nb) the client's crosshair will 'zip', that means the player will unintentionally move his crosshair from one point to another (this is similar behaviour as with 'extended ascii userinfo bug', where a player who connects with bad chars in userinfo will make all clients on the server zip their crosshair)\r\n\r\nb is very interesting. Maybe you can debug command buffer to see what is happening there.",
