I'm not entirely sure why this happens, but my best guess would be that the binocular code runs faster since it is simpler: There is no need to check for which scoped weapon is currently used, etc. The fix is kinda hackish, since it slows down the binoc code (adding an intermediary black screen for 150 msec), but it seems to work. Now the binoc and scoped weapons fade effect seems to happen at the same speed, and the transition snap is no more visible when using binoc.",
