Most specifically the \"movaps\" instruction was failing\nbecause it could not null several structure fields (in token_t) at once,\nbecause it could not operate properly on Z_Malloc'ed memory block, as the\ninstruction requires a 16 byte boundary alignments, where Z_Malloc only does\n4/8 byte paddings (depending on the system). The token_t alignment was 16 byte\ndue to the usage of \"long double\" type on \"floatvalue\" field, which is\nextraordinarily big, even though on the 32bit systems it still occupies\n12bytes, the struct alignment stays within 4 bytes, because the type is\nnon-atomic. The token_t \"floatvalue\" and \"intvalue\" now matching the\n\"pc_token_t\" field types, as this makes more sense, since \"pc_token_t\" is the\nstructure used to receive \"token_t\" values on the mod side.\n\n* fixed botlib token_t alignment, was breaking sse optimization (causing\nthe crash)\n* shut some botlib warnings",
