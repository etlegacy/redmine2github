It breaks ABI, but is likely to be shipped as default on most Linux distribution once the major libraries are made compatible (5.2 is already the default on my distribution). On the medium term, we have to ensure that scripts in the repo work with both Lua 5.1 and 5.2, and we'll have to care only about 5.2 on the long term.",
