I don't mean to bitch but don't really get it.\r\n\r\n1/ Because every player issue is \"Very High\" priority from the player point of view, while issue that affects only one player in the whole userbase is simply \"very low\" priority from the devs point of view. We have a lot of real \"high\" priority tickets, and yours certainly isn't one (I read \"Arch\", \"etlegacy\" and \"Vm_Create\" and basically knew what was going on = you didn't even read the PKGBUILD meh). \r\n\r\n2/ Users that report issues as \"high\" priority without even knowing what's going on are usually just bitching (no offense here, just experience). It's always better not to set the priority yourself and let devs do it.\r\n\r\n> 2; I tried to set version to 2.74 as the version number of my packages but there was no option for that, only 2.75, how come?\r\nNo idea what you mean here. You might want to contact the AUR maintainer for the missing dep and this issue I guess.\r\n\r\nEdit: Ah, I understand what you mean now. We use the \"target version\" as the release in which the bugs should be (hopefully) be fixed. As 2.74 is already out, the target version for current issues is 2.75.",
