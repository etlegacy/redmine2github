    "subject": "Mouse cursor in game menu not moving",
    "description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm facing the problem with not responding cursor in game menu. \r\nThis is my first install on MacOS. Previously I was using ETLegacy on Windows and had no issues.\r\n\r\nI went through installation guide for MacOS, copied PAK files from WolET, run command in terminal (cd /Applications/ && xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ET\\ Legacy/) and game run without issues. Except one major thing - in-game cursor is not moving and is stuck in the top left corner of the screen. In the meantime, MacOS black cursor is present on the screen and, as you may expect, is useless. I cannot click anything in game menu with it. Keyboard arrows for switching between menu options are working. \r\n\r\nI managed to use keyboard arrows/enter to join one server and this issue was still present.\r\n\r\nI found few topics related to mouse issues but they were mainly for in-game cursor freezing and problems with aiming. I found nothing similar to my problem.\r\n\r\nGame version: ETLegacy v2.76\r\nSystem: MacOS Mojave 10.14.5\r\n",
