Just like 'lockteam' in competitive stopwatch matches.\r\n\r\nThis is actually a very good point. You pretty much summed up what I was thinking (which I couldn't make into words). Those two environments are just so different. Those who are so called 'casual' gamers like myself, do enjoy the freedom to choose what to do and expect things to be less strict. And when it comes to competitive, it's a whole new ball game. There are bunch of rules and guidelines and would be more strict wether a player is able to do something or not.\r\n\r\nSo if there ever comes a ticket that has an affect in matter of gameplay, these two environments should be looked at individually. Have to remind myself about that next time.\r\n\r\n-*S",
