I was able to compile the 64bit version which after a few hours of testing didn't freeze.\r\nHowever this was a debug build so I'm not 100% sure if this is fixed in latest git or if not being an optimized build hides the problem.\r\n\r\nRaFaL and spyhawk provided some guidance on IRC, including build scripts.\r\nI was not able to compile a 32bit version due to several missing dependencies.\r\nRaFaL was kind enough to provide one using latest git but the binaries were incompatible with my system causing a segfault immediately at execution.\r\n\r\nSo with that, I'd like to say this is indeed fixed but I'd like to try it under the same conditions, i.e. a 32bit build with same parametrization used for release of 2.72.\r\nIf you can provide this build I'd be happy to test it.",
