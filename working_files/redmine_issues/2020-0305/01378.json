    "description": "Currently pmove_fixed is forced by the server by default, however, you are still able to reset it on the client side, but this won't be communicated over the net, so you'll end up getting bunch of prediction errors. This seems to be an etmain bug, but most of mods did fix this, including etpro, jaymod and etpub (and etjump) by allowing setting the value per client, legacy already has the code that is meant to parse the value from useirinfo cvar.",
