Do you think it is really worth splitting the Favorites by profiles, or one set of favorites per installation would be enough?\r\n\r\nPer profile distinction is just something that comes up intuitively i think, hence the proposal. Edge cases aren't that important, i would think of adding a cvar to allow displaying all servers from all profiles, but i would not consider this wise for security reasons. We can start making it per profile, but then change the behavior if it would be requested.\r\n\r\nAnyways abit offtopic but in addition to facade issue, we definitely should look onto making legacy main menu experience the most attractive way to start connecting to the servers, so the more features we add the better for us.",
