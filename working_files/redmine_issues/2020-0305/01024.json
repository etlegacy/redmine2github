Now the only issue here remains is that you can scope before the switch animation or almost any other animation has even finished.\r\nBy this I mean that when you switch from another weapon to sniper and press MOUSE2 to zoom, you can zoom before the previous animation has finished. By solving this will probably solve many of the altweap issues.\r\n\r\n-*S",
