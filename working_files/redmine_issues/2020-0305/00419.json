I got the latest build and deleted my etconfig.cfg to make sure that none of the set controls or settings were making this problem occur. I went striaght away to the \"Controls\" and set console to full screen, texts dissappeared, same when I went to \"View\". I restarted my client. Tried the same again and no problems occured. So this problem is occuring inconsistently.\r\n\r\nSo after a further thinking I have listed below some facts about the current issue:\r\n\r\n- This problem occured back in Windows 7 64-bit in vanilla ET\r\n- This problem occurs in Windows 8.1 64-bit ET:L and vanilla ET\r\n- SLI isn't causing the problem\r\n- Problem occurs inconsistently\r\n\r\n-*S",

It was after a certain amount of time I was playing and I noticed that many of the texts were just disappearing all by sudden. I tried some other menus like \"View\" and the same thing happened. I don't know what I did to make that happen but I couldn't reproduce it anymore.\r\n\r\nBut there was another thing I could reproduce and it was that after connecting to the ET: Legacy server I went into \"Controls\". Then I just pressed Alt+\u00a7 to get console on fullscreen. I saw letters and texts missing from the top of the console.\r\n\r\nMy operating system is Windows 8.1 Enterprise. And I was using the ET:L build from December 7th.\r\n\r\n-*S",
