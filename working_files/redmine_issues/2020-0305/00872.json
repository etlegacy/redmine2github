            "notes": "There are two things in this I would like to adress.\r\nFirst, the enableBreath effect (small clouds in front of the player mouth) works *only* if the player is downed and waiting for a medic. It doesn't work when the player is alive.\r\nSecond, the effect works *only* on surfaces that have \"surfaceparm snowsteps\".\r\n\r\nI think it would be great, if this could be bound to the \"TraceMap\":http://wiki.splashdamage.com/index.php/Trace_Maps. Environmental effects (snow and rain) are using TraceMaps to know where to cast those effects and probably Artillery and Air Strikes are also checking this TraceMap for info whether they should go through or not.\r\n\r\nThis would make the effect actually useable and I think it's as close to 'perfect' as possible.\r\n",

Right now it only appears if whatever the player is standing on, has *surfaceparm snow* in its shader.\r\n\r\nI understand the arguments behind it, but I think it is not wise to restrict this effect like that. If it is possible I think restricting it to areas that are underneath the sky (like artillery support) would be a better solution. I'm not entierly sure if having it globally on the map is a good idea, because it is unusual inside buildings.",
