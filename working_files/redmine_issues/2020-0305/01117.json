    "description": "Currently in sv_paks and sv_paknames (as part of CS_SYSTEMINFO) all pk3s/maps on the server are referenced which is not needed.\r\n\r\nIdea:\r\n\r\n- create a whitelist for custom pk3s (server cvar)\r\n- only reference plain install pk3s, pk3s from the whitelist and the current map in sv_pak vars.\r\n\r\nBy only referencing the real required pk3s CS_SYSTEMINFO will no longer be cut when too many pk3s (maps) are on server and we have *all* benfits of a in total shorten CS. \r\n\r\n{TODO}\r\nFind the cause why campaign mode doesn't only trigger map download for the current map. Other maps from campaign have to be downloaded for the first connect.\r\n",
