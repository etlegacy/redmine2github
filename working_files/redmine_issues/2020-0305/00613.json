This is at the moment how ET:L prioritizes the weapons after you are out of ammo:\r\n\r\nPrimary -> Secondary -> Grenades -> Weaponslot 5 (syringe as medic, pliers as engineer...)\r\n\r\nThere's something totally wrong there. If you are out of ammo from primary and secondary it should switch to knife. So the weapon order would be like this:\r\n\r\nPrimary -> Secondary -> Knife\r\n\r\nIf it's kept as original, it should switch to knife after you are out of grenades also.\r\n\r\n-*S",
