In R2, it's just set.\r\n\r\nZturtleman has some opinions about this split here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/wiki/Research:refEntity_t-Lighting-Control\r\n\r\nI mean we can get this in with an extra cvar called eg ambientstrenght in tr_global or in trRefLight_t.\r\nAll this must be inspected",
