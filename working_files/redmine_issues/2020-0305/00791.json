I think it happens more often that you by accident throw mines near your obj (when reaching for adrenaline in NQ).\r\nAlso what about defusing satchels? Because a cvops could have a satchel next to the CP and when you construct the CP first, he will blow you up after hearing the announcement.\r\n\r\n1. dynamite\r\n2. satchel\r\n2. constructible\r\n3. mines",
