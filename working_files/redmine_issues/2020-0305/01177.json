When you simply add up stats, you get overall stats for the match but you cannot compare 1st and 2nd rounds anymore, wheras stats for each round can be automatically saved on files.\r\nWhat we can do however, is a 1st round stats (as done actually), and later a 2nd round stats + total match stats (in console) + maybe a detailed match file with both rounds and total numbers.",

So generally the statistics would add up everywhere, but additionally there would be statistics of 2nd round provided in the console.\r\n\r\nBtw. comparing stats of 1st and 2nd round is a bit pointless as you play on defense and offense and the damage, kills and deaths will always be different.
