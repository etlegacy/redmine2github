Also there is an issue sometimes when a lot of text is printed it will not show my input until i hit enter. I assume that it is easily fixed, however I do not know C very much at all and I just go by trial error...\r\nAlso I made /condump (with no arguments) save a condump with the current time/date as the name.\r\nI attached ss of what myn looks like (Ignore the lua stuff in the console :D)",
