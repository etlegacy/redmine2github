When adding the jaymod2.2.0.pk3 file to my jaymod folder, it crashes.\r\nWhen I load the jaymod at begin screen, it loads without problem. Just joining a server does not work. It worked once, but after that it kept on crashing.\r\n\r\nAnd when will the 2.73 version be released?",

Asking continuously about the release date won't make it come faster (however, diving in the code and contributing actively to the project can).\r\n\r\nYou can install the windows version (bootcamp) if you can't wait, or buy a windows PC, or install Linux.",
