There are two ways to update executables:\r\n\r\n# There is an incomplete code which is supposed to download and execute an updater installer. This is a clean way of doing updates on Windows, but it would realistically work only on Windows and Mac. Additionally, we would have to create update installer for each minor release.\r\n# We could hotswap the ET:L executable if it is user-writeable (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9162969/how-can-a-c-binary-replace-itself). However, there are several problems with this approach. First, users usually install ET:L in @Program Files@ on Windows or in @/Applications@ on Mac OS X, which are not user-writeable, so this would not work. Second, ET:L version would not be updated in the Windows registry or in the App bundle.",

If not, we can do what Spyhawk suggested and we won't even have to touch client code, because the autoupdate server can just send a download with @DL_FLAG_URL@. \r\n\r\nFinally, if someone installs ET:L once, he will be able to do it again.

Autoupdate will only ever work on linux if ET:L is installed in the user's home directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
