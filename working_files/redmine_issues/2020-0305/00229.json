Not saying it is a small task but that way we dont need to upkeep another binary and every server maybe configured for tv slave support instead of servers starting up another binary.\r\n\r\nhttp://wolfwiki.anime.net/index.php/ETTV:Server_Configuration\r\n\r\nThe reason i'm all for the rewrite is simple, if we just simply support the existing ettv implementation that means we basically support the usage of 2.6 servers instead of the etl servers.\r\n\r\nAs a side note: at some point when 2.60b fix was not yet released many actually used the modified ettv binary as a normal game server instead of the original server binary.\r\n\r\nPS. i do like the sound of ETLTV.. :D",
