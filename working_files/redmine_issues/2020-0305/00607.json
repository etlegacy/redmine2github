I will see what I remember.\r\nI could basically only \"copy\" an entity like a med pack or even a person (stuck in a certain animation).\r\nHowever, if I remember correctly, after its spawned I wasn't able to change its origin. Also couldn't ever figure out how to make the medpack heal either.\r\nAlso I think there was a bug with either setting getting a string value from a entity fieldname (\"classname\") where it would cut the first letter(I believe it was first, might be last) I don't recall if that was still present in the legacy mod though.\r\n\r\nA lot of my issue I believe was everything I tried was trial and error, I have only a general knowledge of the actual gamecode to create an entity and what each field should be set to.\r\n\r\nhttps://bitbucket.org/zelly/lua-enhanced-server-mod/src/90f823a4ad32057e6639eacbee5c6948724a5420/LESM/EntityHandler.lua?at=quickrefactor&fileviewer=file-view-default#EntityHandler.lua-529\r\nIs basically where I was at.
