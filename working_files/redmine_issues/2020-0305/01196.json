I do assume this is caused by something in the mod or server.  In fact I dunno both configs and other internals so it's just my first impression ... but the server you did point to in above image is using a facade and is highly customized. You really want to play with fire - perhaps here is one result.\r\n\r\nI've changed the print to developer only. The issue doesn't occure with the legacy mod.",
