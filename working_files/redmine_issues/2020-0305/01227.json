            "notes": "The issue seems to come and go accross a single game. Interestingly, it seems the axis percentage is sometime gone, and sometimes both percentage are gone (but never the allies percentage alone). Since the allies percentage is computed on the basis of the axis percentage server-side, it looks like the win percentage is correctly done at ant time, but the values aren't always sent correctly to clients for display. See CG_ParseSkillRating() for the client end. This looks like some sort of overflow happening on the server end just before sending the values (maybe when server is highly populated?).\r\n\r\nIn any case, the win percentage is done correctly. This is only a minor display issue.\r\nPossible solution: increase buffer size in G_SendSkillRating().",
