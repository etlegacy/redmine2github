    "description": "We should ensure the original WolfET logo is replaced too, since we have our own logo. This might also be important in case we ever go standalone, or to avoid any direct legal trouble.\r\n\r\n* replace logo in UI (limbo panel, image preview in server browser...)\r\n* keep the Axis flag for now. While it could be replaced by a generic Axis logo, it might be bad to lose the \"Wolf\" feeling entirely.\r\n* keep the WolfET logo somewhere in credits? We actually never mention ETL is based on WolfET source code...\r\n* -update the legalities to include Zenimax (which acquired Id Software in 2009), see https://splashdamage.com/legal/- (done)",
