    "subject": "Increase amount of trigger_objective_info",
    "description": "Currently there is a limit of 18 \"trigger objective_info\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=trigger_objective_info per map.\r\nYou need one for every objective, constructible, destructible,... Basically for anything that has a track (\"You are near ... \") or that has an icon in the command map.\r\nThere is a reason why maps in ET are basically always the same, because it is incredibly easy to run into this limit. Is there a reason why this limit is in the code or is it just random?\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example at the \"bottom of this page\":http://www.pythononline.co.uk/et/tutorial28.htm#script is Fueldump with 14 *ToI*s in the standard version.\r\nThen there is a version with spawns in both of the CP locations and for both teams, which is an additional 4 ToIs and we are already at the set limit. \r\nNow imagine if a mapper wated to make a version where the river isn't frozen, the tunnel grate is filled with water and there is a water pump in the tunnel bunnker that will drain the tunnel grate, we would need another one. The more a mapper wants to get creative (not necessarily good) the faster he runs into trouble and has to do the same old shit that has been done for more than a decade now.\r\n\r\nInteresting read on the subject is the \"readme of Baserace beta3\":http://et.trackbase.net/map/643/",
