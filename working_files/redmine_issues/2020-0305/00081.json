It still installs into /usr/games which is not allowed for openSUSE.\r\n\r\nAlso installing the binaries and data files to /usr/lib or do some ln -sf crap is not optimal. It would be great if it could search for pk3 in /usr/share/etlegacy store the *.so libraries in /usr/lib and install the binaries in /usr/bin.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a problem in all http://ioquake3.org/ derivatives so a fix should be contributed up-upstream. :)",
