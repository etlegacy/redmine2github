Is it basically about what maps (pk3s) client sees in path in between map loading?\r\nIt's all about referenced paks and names in SV_SpawnServer. We might remove or add pk3s physically in path before the server inits the pak related cvars (after SV_BotFrame).  \r\n\r\nTo ensure file operations are quickly done especially for adding pk3s we may create a separate map pool path so the files just have to be moved in the file system. Or we store inactive maps by zip extension in etmain and rename them to activate (supply.zip -> supply.pk3).   ",
