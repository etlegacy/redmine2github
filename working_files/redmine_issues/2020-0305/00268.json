Now the problem is that some \"brushes\" can be seen through, but the antiwallhack seems them like a solid.\r\n\r\nIt can be seen in the movie I made. The palms have a huge playerclip - which blocks movement, but not the sight or bullets. And it seems that the antiwallhack does not differe there. \r\n\r\n\r\nLastly the command map issues and other issues .. are cause of this antiwallhack.\r\nThe antiwallhack alters the information of the position of a player, so they will appear at wrong place. Either above or below you - it can be seen when you start the game with devmap, and toggle r_shownormals.\r\n",
