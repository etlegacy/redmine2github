            "notes": "since there occured certain misunderstandings in IRC:\r\nI'm talking ONLY about the situation when your clip is empty, but you still have other clips left.\r\nSome prefer the comfort to use *auto-reload* which is more comfortably (depending on your preferies/style of play) but a disadvantage in certain situations.\r\n*auto-switch* would be the exact same thing, simply from a different angle. It brings you comfort (when you switch in-fight anyways) but raises disadvantages in other situations.\r\n\r\nBasically you could specify the gun-behavior when the clip is empty with these parameters: OFF/AUTO-RELOAD/AUTO-SWITCH\r\n\r\nWhy should we provide the possibility to make the game more comfortable for some players, but not for others?\r\nImo ET is the most tweakable game there is. You can modify everything from gameplay to graphics, why not increase the personalization?\r\n",
