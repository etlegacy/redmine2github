Actually, what we have to do is waiting for the very last second before reinforcement before tapping out (to maximize probability that medics can find and revive us), and I do sometimes miss the tap out time by a few millisecond... resulting in being in limbo for the next 20 or 30 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe \"drawback\" of this change would be that you can't tap out tactically easily anymore (actually, killed medics can tap out to give medpack to mates that need it). The /kill keyboard shortcut could solve this issue. \r\n\r\n",

Tapping out tactically is part of the game and missing to tap out too :D\r\n\r\nWell, I see this feature more as an improvement and wouldn't have proposed it if I felt it was changing the gameplay. To me, this would solve an annoying game behavior without changing anything else (at least if the tactical tap out is still possible). The additional code complexity might not be worth implementing however. \r\n\r\n> ... of course it's nice to keep players in game but for this I would rather implement the 'give health' syringes for players <20% HP.\r\n\r\nUnlike the above, this sounds like a real total gameplay change. :P\r\n\r\n",

If you want to completely tap out, then go to the Limbo Menu (L) and click on Respawn, or you can just use /kill. Once you're completely tapped out, you can spectate other players on your team to see how the game is going, plan your next move, or find where the action is heading.\"",
