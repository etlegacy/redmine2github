(probably SP only?)\r\nThis has actually always bugged me in ET that you could cook the dynamite and it would do the same ticking as with a nade, however, it has no effect.\r\n\r\nI don't know if it's wise to immediately drop the dynamite so the player is not able to hold mouse1 anymore, however, it should definitely not tick when being held.",
