Both times i had my settings reset for some reason, while i was testing something.\r\nI was wondering about the performance issues.\r\nI knew that even my old pc was good enough to run ET at 125 fps, so i started messing with the settings and ended up at blob shadows being the problem.\r\nBoth the old and new pc have AMD processors\r\n[/quote]",

            "notes": "It seems that depending on the underground, the plane of the shadow is manipulated. Likely to avoid sticking out, going in or z-fighting with the underground.\r\n\r\nAs visible in the screenshots, the verts/tris count significantly increases when on inclined underground. Flat (06) is only 12 verts / 6 tris, while \r\nshot05 is 16+ verts and the last one is just messed up.\r\nI do believe that when many players are in a scene with difference in terrain height (Railgun was mentioned above), that this has an impact on FPS. The thing is, that I don't think it's quite possible to change the manipulation of the shadow plane, because then we might have shadows that go into terrain or hover out of it.\r\n\r\nThere is an option to to disable them (cg_shadows 0) if the perceived decline in FPS is too much. As a non-competitive player I was always happy with FPS >70. But that's personal preference, I guess^^\r\n\r\nSo, I guess issue confirmed, but I don't know what we could do here? \r\nThe shadow consists of 3 planes. One big blob for body and two smaller ones for feet. I guess it would be possible to have cg_shadows 2 with only the body blob? \r\nThat way, you prevent the complete weirdness of not having shadows, but only have around a third of drawn verts/tris?",
