    "description": "ET has 5 classes in each team, each having an uniform clearly designed to be easily recognizable during battle.\r\nIt would however be great to introduce more cosmetic variation, with semi-randomized faces for each player. If not random, they could be selected from a bigger pool of available faces.\r\n\r\nSee \"ET-HQ\":https://github.com/acqu/wet-headquarters from acqu. which implements a complete character customization system - though I doubt we should go to that extreme.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever dreamed of playing as a medic while proudly harboring a mustache, this is for you!",
