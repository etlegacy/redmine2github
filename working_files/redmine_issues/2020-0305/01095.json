    "description": "Slick surface merged together with solid brush, ie. solid brush + slick brush on top of each other(slick brushes are also solid btw), breaks slick functionality on 45 degree angled plane, this isn't reproducible on 64bit build, it only happens on 32bit linux builds, windows builds don't get bugged. \r\n\r\nThe bug in action, on real map, 45 degree slope just becomes non-slick:\r\nhttps://streamable.com/jus8p\r\n\r\nNow, this obviously doesn't happen with 2.60b, BUT the same bug appears  also in et300, which could mean, that any GPL based engine modification should inherit the very same problem!\r\nMakes me wonder if compilation flags are sort of messed up? cmake shows that fast-math is enabled, so i don't know.\r\nI didn't test master builds(2.77), since i don't have linux installed, capable to run 32bit builds atm, so i hope someone can test that for me, but the bug should be reproducible on 2.76.\r\n\r\n!https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/353604235926962179/457545574724665355/unknown.png(45icetest)!\r\nThe attached map to test bug on:\r\n* right slope - slick + brush on top of each other, \r\n* center - just slick, \r\n* left slope - brush + slick, that was moved 1 unit away, so they don't overlap together. \r\n\r\nThe right one should bug, the rest are fine.",
