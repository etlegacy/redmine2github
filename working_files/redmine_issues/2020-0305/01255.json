Could we, please, have an option to change where to store the downloaded content like maps, mods, server files, etc, to a different location than the friggin My Documents directory. in 2.77?\r\n\r\nJa, it may be 21st century but few of us still are lazy to reinstall our Windows OS after decades of using it. Besides I have amounted less space on my C drive cause I wasn't using the PC so often... back then.",
