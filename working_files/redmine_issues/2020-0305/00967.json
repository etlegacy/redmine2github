Either the arty shell should be given a \"team\" (if that makes sense) so we can differentiate between genuine kills and teamkills, or not counted at all.\r\n\r\nI also believe arty bar being refilled after team switch is fine. Team refill bars are independent counters.",

    "description": "The title is quite self-describing but I'll open up this issue a bit.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Choose either Axis or Allied field ops\r\n2. Call an artillery/airstrike\r\n3. Change team or go to spectators\r\n\r\nThis basically brings some sort of problems:\r\n\r\n- You are granted any kills you while airstrike is going during your went to spectators or changed team\r\n- When changing team it could be abused to get kills (Call of Duty 4 all over again with grenades!), creating a negative game experience\r\n- And when changing team you get fully refilled chargebar (This should definitely be changed)\r\n\r\n-*S\r\n",
