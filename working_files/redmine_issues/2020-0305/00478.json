    "description": "So every ET player is familiar with the points system, aka the infamous XP system. But there is another one that is more unknown although it is implemented in the code: Game Points. The GP score isn't shown in-game at all, nor it is displayed on the scoreboard after a game. Instead, it shows up only in the console output.\r\n\r\nGame Points is similar to a dumbed down XP system. It tracks points in one category only according to various actions, and it seems to be a left over of the RTWC code and/or the \"OSP mod for RTWC\":http://www.orangesmoothie.org/wolf/.\r\n\r\nAlong with some stats similar to the in-game XP system (Team Damage, ..), the console stats also outputs:\r\n* the number of suicide\r\n* the kill/death \"efficiency\" (kill / (kill + death))\r\n* the GP score\r\n\r\nThe idea is to merge both of these stats system, so the final scoreboard and console output display the same information. The GP system might be also entirely removed.\r\n\r\nAlso, to consider:\r\n* -adding number of suicide in debrief screen- (done)\r\n* -removing the kill/death \"efficiency\" (kill / (kill + death)) ?- (we keep it)\r\n* -adding the GP score to the debrief screen or removing it entirely- (removed)\r\n* -adding a HS percentage might be a good idea too.- (done, added global accuracy and HS ratio)\r\n* -showing the time effectively played (currently: time connected only) in each team/as spec.- (done, showing: total/axis/allies)\r\n* computing (or not) as hit when shooting non gibbed corpse (see g_stats from ETPub).\r\n* -adding number of gib (like OSP mod)- (done)\r\n* -adding team damage given/team damage received- (done)\r\n* -added TeamKill and Selfkill in debriefing screen and stats window- (done)\r\n* -time being alive (maybe as a percentage of time played)- (done)\r\n* -kills according to enemy spawntimer (see \"request in forum\":http://dev.etlegacy.com/boards/3/topics/813), although this might be overkill.- (overkill)\r\n\r\nThis ticket concerns only the \"micro\" in-game statistics. The implementation of a more global stats system is tracked in #403. ",
