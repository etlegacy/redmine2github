But I report this as a bug because the issue is the following.\r\nHow this should work: <class> <primary> <secondary>\r\nBut in fact it doesn't work as intended?\r\nCurrently I'm able to choose class and all the classes are like this:\r\n- 0 = soldier\r\n- 1 = medic\r\n- 2 = engineer\r\n- 3 = field op\r\n- 4 = covert op\r\nAnd primary weapons work by taking them by their number, as soldier 1 = MP40/Thompson; 2 = Panzerfaust/Bazooka...\r\n\r\nAnyway the secondary, I thought it would work the same as primary 1 for single pistol and 2 for akimbo, but it wasn't like that. The values for akimbo are totally unknown.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to see is this for example: team r 1 1 1 - This would be for Axis medic with MP40 and single Luger and with the same way 1 1 2 would be MP40 and akimbo Lugers.\r\n\r\nI didn't find these document the same way as on NQ forums, where these are used for Lua.\r\n\r\n-*S",
