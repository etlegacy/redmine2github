In Jaymod you can actually see the enemy players in compass while playing without covert ops spotting them.\r\n\r\nThis also includes the possibility for an exploit as players could easily join spectators briefly to see where the opponents are. Maybe this could be limited to shoutcasters. Regular players still can rotate through the other team members to see where they are, but that way they would have to spend more time and it is harder to get a whole picture at once.",
