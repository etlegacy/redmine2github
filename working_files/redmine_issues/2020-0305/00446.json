When you have \"weapnext\" bound anywhere, and you try to use that bound key to get the next gun after your silenced pistol, it gives an issue. Normally it would just get your next weapon, Sten or whatever. But in this case it makes the sound that it would take the silencer off but it doesn't even take it off.\r\n\r\nEDIT: When you throw a smokescreen while you had silencer pistol on your hand before. And then you start pressing \"2\" continously for the pistol, it starts making the sound that you would take the silencer off and put it back all the time. So the sound repeats itself each time you press \"2\".\r\n\r\n-*S",
