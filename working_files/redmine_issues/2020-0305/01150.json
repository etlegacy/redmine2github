Thanks!\r\n\r\nHey hellreturn,\r\n\r\nuser:Spyhawk already referred to this, but to be a little more clear: I will implement an \"improved inactivity checker\":https://dev.timosmit.com/bugtracker/view.php?id=90 in the \"next WolfAdmin release\":https://dev.timosmit.com/bugtracker/roadmap_page.php?version_id=9 (which is 1.3.0). This will include some more advanced game administration features such as inactivity check, censor and probably also clan name/clan tag protection. As these features will be part of WolfAdmin, it's easy for me to integrate these well-known overrides for specific admin levels. Thanks for the suggestion nevertheless!",
