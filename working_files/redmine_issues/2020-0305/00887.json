For casual players I think it's a good thing as it retains your progress but I can also see the counter of that for something like campaign where you'd want to have progress start and end tied to the campaign progress.  I understand if not including XP save under the et:legacy umbrella is desired from a purity perspective however, but I'm a fan of it.  It also tends to be preferred by most players I've noticed from running servers.  I do not retain bot experience however, and reset that every 45minutes or so.\r\n\r\n",

Let's drill down into heavy weapons skill for example, soldier with MG42 is very underpowered (small ammo cap, heavy weapons restrictions) yet the suppressive fire is a very important element to the game.  Further ranks of heavy weapons skill can accommodate carrying a greater amount of ammo (let's say max of 500 rds, up from 150 that you start with) and an incremental decrease in MG overheating for heavy weapons, or an incremental increase in reload time (presumably from having more experience operating it at a higher level). \r\n\r\nTo lay out exact increments:\r\n\r\n(current)\r\nbattle sense = level 4\r\nlight weapons = level 4\r\nheavy weapons = level 4\r\n\r\n(proposed)\r\nbattle sense = level 10\r\nlight weapons = level 10\r\nheavy weapons = level 10\r\n\r\n> > I see what you mean.\r\n> Note that it is not only about retaining XPs.
