    "description": "There are 4 cvars in ET for a bobbing effect:\r\n\r\n/cg_bobpitch simulates a head 'bobbing\u2019 effect when moving, by giving the camera a forwards/backwards movement similar to nodding. \r\n/cg_bobroll simulates a head 'bobbing\u2019 effect when moving, by giving the camera a left/right movement similar to \"sideways-nodding\". \r\n/cg_bobup simulates a vertical body 'bobbing\u2019 effect when taking a step by giving the camera a vertical jerk. Feels inconsistent!\r\n/cg_bobyaw likely was intended to simulate a sideways body 'bobbing\u2019 effect when taking a step by turning the camera left and right.  \r\n\r\n/cg_bobyaw was already commented in \"original ET source\":https://github.com/id-Software/Enemy-Territory/blob/40342a9e3690cb5b627a433d4d5cbf30e3c57698/src/cgame/cg_view.c#L697 and has been removed in ET: Legacy.\r\n\r\n/cg_bobpitch and /cg_bobroll have the same default of \"0.002\" and /cg_bobup has a very similar default of \"0.005\".\r\n\r\n\r\nI propose to remove the remaining 3 cvars as well and simply bundle them in one cvar: /cg_bobbing.\r\nI tried 0.002 on all three of them and camera movement still feels very normal, so no real computation to derive cg_bobup from the base value would be necessary.",
