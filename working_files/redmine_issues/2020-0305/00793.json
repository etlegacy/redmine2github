ET's reload animations are split into 3 parts (the reasons why escape me at this point). Each is controlled by a weapons.cfg under etmain. The path is etmain/models/weapons2/sten/weapon.cfg. The line which reads (with a comment) RELOAD2, I changed the fps value from 20 to 29. I've regretted for a while that this seems slightly slow =) Perhaps changing it to 30 or 31 would fit nicely. Anyway there's no need to bother with worrying about the sound file's pitch and frequency (id's devs certainly didn't). Hope this helps. (Modified file attached in case I was ambiguous).",
