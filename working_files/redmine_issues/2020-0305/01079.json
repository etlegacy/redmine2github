    "description": "Reported by hatcher:\r\nPlayers should be able to cancel the reload action to be able to defend themselves in a sudden firefight. They are already weakened by wasting time pulling out the secondary.\r\n\r\nSwitching weapons during reload, even milliseconds before finishing, should obviously result in an empty clip when switched back. As this might result for unwanted behaviour for people who want to switch after reload and preliminarily press 2, this might need a cvar.\r\n\r\nIf you still have bullets in your primary and want to reload to get a full clip, you should not be allowed to cancel the reload and shoot the remaining bullets. Cancelling should only be allowed by switching to the secondary weapon.",
