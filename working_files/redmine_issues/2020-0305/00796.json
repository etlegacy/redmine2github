A simpler way to handle the issue is to only display the XPs earn in current map (or XP earn in campaign if using campaign mode) as it is already done with the end of game stats / awards.\r\nLet's kill XP save slowly but surely. :P",

The limbo menu in my eyes acts like the player profile Atleast until I can find the time and motivation to burry myself in the menu UI code, to create a proper player menu with stats and shit.
