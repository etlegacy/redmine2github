I might also be able to provide the needed SDL2 version with the Linux builds in the OBS soon.\r\n\r\nThe only possible issue as I see it is people spreading self-compiled non bundled version, and that have no idea what they are doing.

Yes, it's technically possible to mess around and launch with an old lib, but I don't think this is realistic.\r\nAlternatively, it might be possible to generate the hard check dynamically from the CMake script (like it is done with the version number).\r\n\r\n",
