Anyway, it doesn't hurt to follow standard conventions.\r\n\r\n> To have a clean uninstall of ETL we would have to clean the outside path too ...\r\nNot in standard paths. It would be deleted automatically on most *nix systems, e.g. on linux @/var/run@ is @tmpfs@ and it's specified in the FHS. Otherwise it would get full of orphaned pid files over time. \r\n\r\n",
