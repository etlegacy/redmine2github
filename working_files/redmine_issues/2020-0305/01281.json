It however quite long, maybe we can rename it as \"Add as favorite\" (1 less character)? Any better suggestion here?\r\n\r\nI really like the idea of displaying \"Remove Favorite\" once it's added, but I'm not sure is that is possible with the very inflexible UI system.",

(also in silent 0.9.0, onOPEN events are ignored.)\r\n\r\nSide note: you guys can move the \"LIMBO MENU\" button down directly above the \"DISCONNECT\" button, like it is in NoQuarter since honestly it's the best place for this button, one of you guys can put that in it's own ticket.",

Customized main menus will be more restricted because of admin abuse, and we already have a working system in place (with some minor details to look at).

We should probably move it to the very top, actually.",

(matches noquarter too!)\r\n\r\nThe ingame_main.menu file that has my stated changes is attached below.\r\n\r\n- Ets|PsycoPappy 4",
