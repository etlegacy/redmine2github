    "description": "In the original ET design, campaigns were the heart of the game. They were designed as a suite of 3 maps with skill leveling in mind, and players would reach maximum levels (in one or maybe all categories) on the last map only.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, campaign mode is hardly usable with the existing gazillon of maps, and as such objective or mapvoting tend to be prefered. As a result, the original idea behind XP leveling has been largely left behind, while being largely replaced by XP save, which has infortunate consequences on the gameplay balance.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new dynamic campaign mode, similar to the existing campaign mode gameplay but with the following characteristics:\r\n* dynamically generated with random maps from a pool,\r\n* fully server side, without the need to download any file on the clients,\r\n* designed to be used with skill leveling accross multiple maps (ideally 3), which would then be automatically reset.",
