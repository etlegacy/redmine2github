    "description": "When I'm playing as a lvl4 soldier with SMG and heavy weapon I can pick up opposing team's member SMG but I can't select it.\r\n\r\nExample. I'm axis soldier with MP40 and Flamethrower. MP40 is running low on ammunition and I pick up Thompson from the ground. I hear the pick up sound and my MP40 is now on the ground. But the weapon switches to Flamethrower and I can't select Thompson although I picked it up. Works same on both teams soldier classes.\r\n\r\nET:L 2.75, Windows 10",
