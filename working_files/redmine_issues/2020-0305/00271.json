Private slots are set to 4 by default.\r\n- When listing the existing 2.71RC3 legacy servers, the bot counter isn't accurate. It seems to display \"value minus 1\" instead of the correct value. What's going on here?\r\n- -I'm not sure the human counter for 2.71rc3 servers is working correctly either (still showing zero)...- fixed, I introduced some unwanted change in the last commit.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'll also use the more generic way of detecting bots on the loading screen, instead of relaying on omnitbot_enable - just need to figure out the right way to do it.",

    "description": "Many servers have bots on and these are included in player counts. Some servers just lie somehow about player counts.\r\n\r\nEstablish a metric to give a \"real\" count of players only.\r\n\r\nFirst pass would be to discount all players with zero (0) ping as these are [usually] bots. One can then find a server with lots of players on far more easily.",
