I thought it would be relatively easy to brute-force this, and if you are lucky, you can actually do it quick. But ok, i underestimated sha-2. Maybe there will be really smart cracking algs in the future.\n\nAnother thing: let's say i connect and reconnect many times a sec. Will this cause hash calculations by the server on every time i (re)connect ? Because as i saw, you send the guids directly on clientconnect. So this is another layer of complexity ?
