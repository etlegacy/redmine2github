However you are already able to set affinity by OS so why should we add such a feature again?\n\nI think you don't understand what I mean.\n\nThere is such a cvar in Enemy Territory: Quake Wars:\n> [Dual/Multi-Core Tweaks]\n> \n> r_useThreadedRenderer [0,1,2 ] - Added as of the 1.2 Patch, this option allows you to enable multithreading if you have a dual or multi-core CPU, and this can improve the performance of ET:QW. By default it's disabled (set to 0), but you can set it to either 1 or 2, with a value of 1 locking the renderer to your in-game frames, while 2 allows it to run unlocked. The developers recommend a value of 2 for this variable if you wish to enable it. Note that you must enable it either by inserting it in your autoexec.cfg file, or by entering it in the console prior to the start of a game; it can't be changed during a game.\n\nI mean that something like this could be introduced into ET:L.",

I remember that I had enormous problems with getting it to work on XreaL renderer, while with vanilla it was working perfectly.\r\n\r\nLast two pictures are some experimental build of OpenWolf with most of loops moved into parallelism and compiled with OpenMP.\r\nAt that time I believed that it I move everything into work-sharing constructs that I could get better and more stable engine.\r\n",
