I hate this - several times I did protect the objective I got killed by team dynamite. Warbell construction on top of the roof is best example so yes - he/she should be punished :)\r\n\r\nI don't think we should spend gimmicks for stupidness - each experienced engineer knows planting/arming defuses the chargebar.

    "description": "I got an example here. When you try to plant landmines on places where you can't it will fill your chargebar when you try to arm them. Also the landmine will disappear during the progress. But in dynamite's case, there's not this feature. Instead of giving back your charge into chargebar it let's it be at the state when you threw the dynamite. So my suggestion is clear, when you try to plant dynamite at your own objective, your dynamite will disappear (as it does now) + you will get your chargebar filled again.\r\n\r\n-*S",
