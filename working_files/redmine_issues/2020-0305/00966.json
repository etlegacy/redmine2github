I only really play on the official ET Legacy server, but if I get up to level 4 light weapons as a medic, engineer, field ops or covert ops and then switch to soldier or spectator and then go back to any of the four classes with dual wield pistols, my sidearm resets to a single pistol despite still being level 4 light weapons.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if I get to level 4 heavy weapons and get the smg sidearm and then go spectator or any other class, if I go back to soldier I don't get my smg secondary weapon.\r\n\r\nI haven't tried to recreate this on Windows or Linux, so can't confirm if it is a MacOS specific bug.",
