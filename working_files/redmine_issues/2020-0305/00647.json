    "description": "This: http://dev.etlegacy.com/issues/640 is definitely related to this new ticket. Ok so there are a few issues I found out with binoculars.\r\nFirst of all, the ticket at the start of this post is one but then there is one other minor thing.\r\nWhen you take out your binoculars by pressing 8, you are able to watch through them when you press MOUSE2 which is \"weapalt\". Why it isn't MOUSE1 \"+attack\" for instance? Is it because the only exception is field op? Then I can understand, then it could stay as it is now. But the other pressing issue here is, when you press MOUSE1 underwater, it makes the restriction sound. I can't attack with binoculars anyway, I can only call rtiller yas field op, nothing else.\r\n\r\nSo that restriction sound is a bug at least.\r\n\r\n-*S",
