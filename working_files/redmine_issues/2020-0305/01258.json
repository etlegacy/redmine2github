I think someone complained because they use this engine feature in a mod? (-might be Ensi with TeamFortress?-). It's also cheat protected. We should either make it usuable in ET, or get rid of it (for good). At present, it's plain useless.\r\n\r\nEdit: It was ryven, and this is actually useful for debug when mapping.\r\n\r\nNote: the revert seems partial only (see message modes). That feature might not even behave as it did before removal.",

Then you wouldn't have to open the console anymore.\r\n\r\nObviously, it should only work when the console is closed and it shouldn't be cheat protected.",
