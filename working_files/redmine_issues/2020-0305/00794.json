(This should be in the game imho!)\r\n\r\nThe zoom thing should not be implemented, when zooming the sniper needs to close his scope.. This is how it is in every game and imho for a good reason, without this the sniper would be a bit OP.\r\n\r\nThe same issue as with reload switching exists with the pickup, theres a delay when you cant actually use the weapon (not long but still exists and annoying)",
