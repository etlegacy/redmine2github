Right now the complete responsibility rests with the server admin who can only change it server-wide and since there are always people who might be offended or unhappy with the interrupt in their denial, that's not going to happen.\r\nWith this system the player can choose what he wants to see and doesn't have to take the other players into count.\r\n\r\nAlso in default settings the addon won't be attached to Legacy, that's the whole point. Otherwise german players would already have commited a crime by downloading the game, although they didn't even choose 'uncensored'. They are added to the game in terms of a DLC.\r\n\r\nAbout gore...I wasn't talking about disabling gore in the censored version. I was talking about making it messier in the uncensored version. However this is just optional, introducing historically correct skins is my main concern in this matter. \r\n",
