    "description": "Yesterday I played a LAN using ET 2.60b, and here are the issues I encountered under the Legacy mod:\r\n- When you set yourself ready when the map has ended, the antilag icon used to show this fact is rotated by 180\u00b0.\r\n- The kill messages have a strange issue: in the console they're fine, but in the game the \"by\" word has no space after it, and thus you have \"byPlayerName\" displayed instead of \"by PlayerName\".\r\n\r\nConfirmed by my friend, but we use the same binaries, compiled last Sunday morning.",
