I thought that by upstream you mean the main Legacy development so I came here to see if there is a ticket for this.\r\n\r\nI did a full system upgrade, with GLEW 1.12 included, but there was still no update for the AUR packages and so Legacy didn't work because it was still looking for 1.11\r\n\r\nFinally I force-reinstalled them, now it seems to work. So in the end there WAS and IS an issue with the AUR packages, namely that if you built it before the GLEW upgrade it still shows as up to date while it should be rebuilt.",

All other AUR packages I use - and there are many, believe me - are updating as well when my general components are.\r\n\r\nMay I humbly suggest making a \"cosmetic\"* subversion number update to the AUR package only so that it is definitely being rebuilt with the new new GLEW when the user does a full upgrade? I think the majority of people use AUR with some kind of helper like me, so when they do a full upgrade AUR packages are being checked for new versions and ideally, there is no need to manually upgrade any AUR packages.\r\n\r\n* (well, technically something did change because it needs to build with a different GLEW so the resulting binary has changed, even if the source didn't.)\r\n\r\nEither way, thanks for your replies, I can play now. :) I stop commenting on this ticket now.",
