Same issue as described by Harle above. It goes back to normal when you reach the time you initially set the timer at the previous level (ie, buggy from 1800 to 900 second, then normal from 900 to 0).\r\n\r\nThe fix above simply ensure that cg_spawtimer is set to the map timelimit during warmup, so the value (diff between cg_spawntimer_set and current time) is never negative. It shouldn't have any drawback since you can't use /timerset or /resettimer in warmup.\r\n\r\nThe \"following fix\":https://github.com/Spyhawk/etlegacy/commit/e91c66eb002f7941878a4a022d256fb12d6034de work on my machine (except that I changed the disabled value from -1 to zero, as the timer is useless when the map is finished).\r\n\r\nBy the way, it would be great to have *at least* coherent commands. /settimer drives me crazy :)",
