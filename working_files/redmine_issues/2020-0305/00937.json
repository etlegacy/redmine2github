If anything, I'd consider the current SDL solution as the real fix as we won't hardcode keymap.",

I know I also was strongly for getting back the possibility to open the console with [^] on German keyboard, but I just wanted to say that I take that back. Adding hacks into the code just to compensate old habits is a bit over-the-top. I even noticed that I adjusted my habits already and now I try to open the console in vanilla also with [SHIFT]+[ESC]. Habits are a weird thing...\r\nhttps://dev.etlegacy.com/issues/937\r\nFrom my perspective this can be set to invalid.\r\n\r\nThis is also my opinion.
