All we have to do is add this line in @gameinfo.txt@ of our pak3.pk3:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class=\"json\">\r\n{ 6 \"Map voting\" \"Vote\" \"Players vote for the next map.\" }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nDragon wrote:\r\n> I think I forgot about team deathmatch mode.\r\n\r\nI've never head of that one. Which mod has that? Also, I don't know about any other gametypes. If they exist and use the same gametype number (@gametype = 6@) then we would need to add this line instead:\r\n<pre><code class=\"json\">\r\n{ 6 \"Custom\" \"Cstm\" \"Custom mod gametype.\" }\r\n</code></pre>\r\n\r\nOr perhaps we could negotiate with the main mod teams to standardize new gametype identifiers, for example:\r\n\r\n<pre><code class=\"json\">\r\n  { 0 \"Single Player\" \"SP\" \"Playing with yourself. Woohoo.\" }\r\n  { 1 \"Cooperative\" \"Coop\" \"Playing with yourself. And with others. More woohoo.\" }\r\n  { 2 \"Objective\" \"Obj\" \"Instead of playing through each Map of a Campaign, the Teams can go straight to battle in a single map of their choosing.\" }\r\n  { 3 \"Stopwatch\" \"SW\" \"Each Team struggles to complete the Map's Mission Objectives against the clock. The Teams then swap sides to try to better their opponents' time.\" }\r\n  { 4 \"Campaign\" \"Cmpgn\" \"Both teams battle across a series of maps. Skills and Rewards awarded to each player will persist from map to map.\" }\r\n  { 5 \"Last Man Standing\" \"LMS\" \"Both Teams meet in a map for a fight to the death. Each player only has one life. Use it well.\" }\r\n\r\n  { 6 \"Map voting\" \"Vote\" \"Players vote for the next map.\" }\r\n  { 7 \"Team deathmatch\" \"Tdtm\" \"Let the bullets fly.\" }\r\n  { 99 \"Custom\" \"Cstm\" \"Custom gametype provided by the mod.\" }\r\n</code></pre>",
