I am able to run the game successfully with gcc (debug/no debug) and clang (debug). Only clang without debug symbols exhibits this behavior.\r\n\r\nAttached:\r\nmy_configure_debug: make configure in OpenBSD ports with debug flags turned on\r\nmy_configure_reg: \" with debug flags off\r\nmy_build_debug: make update-plist in OpenBSD ports with debug flags turned on\r\nmy_build_reg: \" with debug flags off\r\nmy_log_debug: game startup with debug flags on (OK)\r\nmy_log_reg: game startup with debug flags off (fails)\r\n\r\nI notice that when the game is starting without an ~/.etlegacy folder, it takes two or three restarts during normal operation. However, the regular clang build will go from\r\nInitializing Legacy ui\r\ndirectly to:\r\n----- CL_Shutdown -----\r\nas shown in my_log_reg.\r\n\r\nI sprinkled in COM_Printf's and saw that in client/cl_ui.c in CL_InitUI(void), the last call to\r\n<pre><code class=\"c\">VM_Call(uivm, UI_INIT, (cls.state >= CA_AUTHORIZING && cls.state < CA_ACTIVE), qtrue, ETLEGACY_VERSION_INT);</code></pre>\r\nfails to get past this point.\r\n\r\nin qcommon/vm.c:\r\n<pre><code class=\"c\">intptr_t QDECL VM_CallFunc(vm_t *vm, int callNum, ...)</code></pre>\r\nThis call\r\n<pre><code class=\"c\">r = vm->entryPoint(callNum, args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3],</code></pre>\r\nfails to get past this point.\r\n\r\nIn sys/sys_main.c I  printed out the signal in Sys_SigHandler(int signal) and noticed that it was 10, which is a SIGBUS.",
