When you spectate a real client who hovers over bot, it will show the healthbar correctly.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Start two clients\r\n2. Start localhost with one of the clients and join to the created localhost with the other\r\n3. Put another client to Allies or Axis and leave the other one into spectators\r\n4. Spectate the client who you just put into either playing team\r\n\r\nAfter these steps, when you hover the aim over a bot with the playing client and look with the other, you will noticed a full healthbar.\r\n\r\n-*S",
