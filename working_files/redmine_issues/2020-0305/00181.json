But in my opinion, we shouldn't focus on existing mods. They'll work anyway, regardless of what is done in etl (either through db access in the mod code, or through Lua). At this time, the only concerned mod is Legacy, and possibly future mods derived from it. \r\n\r\nNote that since it is distributed with etl, there's also no reason to make effort to keep Legacy mod compatibility with 2.60b server (I'm not talking about the 2.60b client here). It might break at some point, or it might even be broken already(?).\r\n\r\nAs I currently see it, the question to be answered is: \"What is the best  way for the Legacy mod and future derived mods?\" And also \"What is the best  way for the Legacy mod and future mods?\", but only once et:l will have taken over the world :P \r\n\r\nBtw Radegast, it would be great if you could write the \"roadmap  and thoughts about the future of ET:L and the Legacy mod\" as discussed a few months ago (it doesn't have to be long, it only needs to define the main direction you are thinking about).",

            "notes": "I'm not really sure how to properly write posts in these as this is my first.\r\n\r\nI have couple of notes that I think should be considered. First, for a server admin having MySQL server on their server is not automatic. For admins who host their servers on paid providers, would need to get the MySQL from their providers. In that sense, using TinySQL could be a better alternative, as the database can be locally stored in the server game folder. Second, MySQL is a resource hog, from the administrator stand point. Third, having to deal with a generic relational database will add a lot of overhead to the mod execution. This could be alleviated by loading required data before the game starts or with asynchronous accessess for example. The first is the easier method of these two. It's a good thing to have a ready made database solution for a new mod, that will let the mod to store whatever data it wants. But I would like to emphasize these needs and especially fetching large results should be taken into acount in the implementation and in the interface.\r\n\r\nP.S. It is unlikely that silEnT will move to a new database solution. But some form of optional compatibility (for admins to get data out) would not be out of the question. If ET SDK licensing allows using interfaces of the GPL version of the engine.",

I don't really think devs will spend time on moving to SQL. What is more they want their mods to be compatible with as wide range of ET versions as possible, they're not going to limit use of their mods to etlded only. Just my opinion.\r\n\r\nET:L is aiming to become _the_ standard.\r\n\r\nI don't expect existing mods to migrate to our database api if they already have a working database solution. This feature is primarily aimed for new mods or those mods that don't have DB support yet. \r\n\r\n",

Yes, I'm sure it can be made efficient, I just wanted to distress these requirements to the disucciosn as they need to be thought out early in the database table design and in the interface. Engine blocked in sleep to wait results from the database would be bad.\r\n",
