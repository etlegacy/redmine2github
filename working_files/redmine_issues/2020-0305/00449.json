It's also less confusing for useres when omni-bot and omnibot (if OB mod is installed) folder are not in the same path (fs_basepath).\r\n \r\nDo we want to keep it as it is or move the install to fs_basepath/omni-bot? \r\n  \r\n",

I think it would be a bit awkward if someone installs another mod and has to set their omnibot_path to a sub path of the legacy mod. In my opinion, it makes the most sense to have it installed in a location that all of the mods currently search for by default since most users aren't likely to be maintaining mod specific installations / configurations.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do think it would be a good idea to include a sub path of the mod as one of the default search locations (and have it be the first location searched). \r\n\r\n",
