We might map the script input too but currently it's just not worth the effort. Tons of work!\r\n\r\nIf we ever run out of entities regularily and we don't have other issues (f.e. network overload which I do expect when the game has to process many real entities in one frame and half of these are updated) we should implement standardized spawns.\r\n",
