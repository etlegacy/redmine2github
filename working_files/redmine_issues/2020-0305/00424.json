It does not work also the arrow buttons, up and down, at the end of such scroll bar. Also the selection of the favourites anche the \"sort by\" fovourites has no effect (am I the only who want these things working? :-o ).\r\n\r\nThe mouse wheel works and also the arrow keys (on the keyboard), after one click on the server list.\r\n\r\nI use Win7 with the ET last release (with \"git pull\" - I am not a developer, but I am able to compile).\r\nThank you!!",
