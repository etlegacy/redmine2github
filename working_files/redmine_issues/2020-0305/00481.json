(what I dislike the most is that they aren't transparent :P).\r\n\r\nAlso, IR4 suggested to color the text of objectives to be done by default, and uncolor the text of obj that are done. It sounds good, but some objectives that are done by a team can be undone by the other (ie, construct / destroy a command post). For this reason, I think keeping the current color code is better.\r\nEdit: nvm the second part, I guess removing only the colors of your team objectives that are done makes sense...  ",
