Unpacking the files on my own fixes the problem. ET:L zip package (http://mirror.etlegacy.com/release/etlegacy-v2.72-win32.zip) seems to be affected as well.\r\n\r\nHow to reproduce:\r\n1. Install ET:L using official installer.\r\n2. Start the game.\r\n3. Connect to any server running mod other than Legacy.",
