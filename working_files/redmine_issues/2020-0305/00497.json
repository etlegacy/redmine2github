But imho, this should be only optional, and needs to be discussed along other optional classes improvements (ie, after 2.71 is released and once we get some \"official\" future planning/vision for the mod from Radegast and others).",

However, I don't think the goatsound creates the \"right\" atmosphere for legacy mod, and I don't believe that \"being standard\" makes it good either.\r\nI personally always have hated this sound (so I'm kinda biased here), because it creates a \"WFT?\" moment that simply doesn't fit (maybe except in fun oriented mod). Also, it isn't this sound that creates a revenge feeling - the backstab itself does.\r\n\r\n> Goat sound is the epitome of fun features, but I would make an exception for it and either keep it as it is or just make it optional. \r\n\r\nTo be honest, I think creating an optional cvar just for this sound is the road to bloatware. I'd rather bear it and heard this sound every time and keeping the mod core as simple and as clean as possible. But I'd still prefer to replace or remove it instead :) ",
