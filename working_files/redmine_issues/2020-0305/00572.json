So eats 100% cpu. There's a quake (4 i think) config cvar and code to make the loop use a callback timer with an interval so that it doesn't eat all cpu, at the expense of possibly less responsive game.\r\nET code is incredibly intertwined between fps / screen refresh setting / sound and network settings. I can successfully make cpu usage around 5% by using an FPS limiter, setting it to any number that is equal or below com_maxfps (the real fps as displayed, which matches magic values 71,76,90,100,125 etc). Have tested with Fraps and the utility to show frametimes. It's as good as or better than without FPS limiting.\r\nMy current best settings (minimal input lag) cl_maxpackets 100, rate 25000, com_maxfps 200, display refresh 100 and the FPS limiter (nvidia profile using nvidia inspector) set to 200, I also use Precision X to make sure the GPU is not throttling back and forth as ET hardly uses GPU but throttling causes problems. I set affinity to the last core and priority High. Windows power profile set to 100 percent all time, all bios power saving features disabled (e.g. Intel SpeedStep, C states, Turbo etc.)\r\n",

The default com_maxfps of 85 (which is actually real fps of 90 because of the engine quirks, use cg_drawfps 1 to see real fps) is bare minimum before you start seeing screen stutter. It should really be 125 or higher. Vsync minimizes somewhat the visual stutter but it's still there. Game should be really run with vsync off on a high refresh monitor.\r\nOriginally the game was setup/meant to run on a 4:3 resolution with 85Hz on a CRT monitor, with vsync on....but on a CRT vsync has no input lag. If you are running it on a 60Hz LCD, don't expect too much goodness, as the game was meant for CRT high refresh.",
