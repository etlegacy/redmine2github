You'll earn 2XP per 30 seconds while 'Warm' (you inflicted damage), 5XP per 30 seconds while 'Hot' (dealing AND receiving damage) and 8XP if 'Super-Hot' (killing and receiving damage).\r\n\r\nWhy would you get 2 XP per 30 seconds when you push your teammate to death? Ammm... makes no sense to me at least. :p And what I have checked, you don't gain any XP when teambleeding normally. I can put more facts to the table to ensure you that this one is a bug. I can give out every detail to confirm this.\r\n\r\n-*S",

Well, there's no enemy so there's no damage to inflict. But for some reason it counts pushing teammates to death as dealing damage to an enemy. I haven't yet tried do you gain xp when the fall damage isn't lethal. That's something which remains to be tested.\r\n\r\n-*S",
