            "notes": "At first, having such a fallback feature when the profile is missing didn't make sense, since the game would ask to create a new profile at startup. When looking at the original ET-GPL sources, we can see that this 'fallback' feature is related to the com_gameInfo.usesProfiles variable that has been removed  from et:legacy a while ago. That code isn't a fallback code, it is in fact part of the old function that has been left behind and thus can be safely removed.\r\n\r\nI've also tested various situation, and can confirm the removal doesn't have any side effect. If the profile isn't defined, a new one will be created. If the profile exists but the etconfig.cfg file isn't present for any reason, a new one with default value will be created.\r\n\r\n ",
