Rain: g_heavyweaponsrestriction only controls airstrike/arty fire right now. We should probably move that into a team_* cvar as well, since to say the current usage of heavyweaponsrestriction with regards to airstrike/arty is not well understood would be an understatement.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n* http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22308\r\n* https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/heavy-weapons-restrictions-on-rtcw-et-servers-please-help/110465/2"

    "description": "Figure out how g_heavyweaponrestriction (etpro) cvar works regarding artillery and airstrikes limitations. It seems it sets an arty and airstrike per-minute limit based on field ops and total team players count.\r\n\r\n\r\nbq. g_heavyWeaponRestriction\r\n\r\nbq. 100 is default. As i understand it, for soldier weapons it refers to the percentage of the team that can select EACH heavy weapon. e.g., if you set it to 20, and in the game there are 10 players on a team, bq. each side could then have up to two panzerfausts, two flamers, two mg42\u2019s and two mortars. If the team has no flamers, this does not allow them to take any additional Panzers.\r\nThe Field Ops use of Artillery is also restricted, but is on a per-minuite basis and takes into account the number of Field Ops. The is calculation is something like the following:\r\n\r\nbq. n(g_heavyweaponrestriction * teamsize)\r\n= max number of artillery per team per minuite\r\n\r\nbq. where n = number of field ops, but minimum is 2 and max is six \r\n(doesnt actually restrict how many field ops you can have, just the number for the formula).\r\n\r\nbq. so: if g_heavyweaponrestriction is 20, there are 10 on the team, and there are 2 field ops, between them they can set off\r\n 2(0.2*10)= 4 artillery per min?\r\n\r\nbq. So we\u2019ve worked out how many artillery can be set up per minuite, which is all most people need to know. If you\u2019re wondering how this \u201cminuite\u201d is calculated (think about it), read the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nbq. The counter starts at 0, and there are 6000msec in a minuite. Every time a player sets off an artillery, 6000/m is added to the counter, and the counter will start counting back down to 0. Once the counter reaches 6000, no more artillery can be fired until it has counted down to under 6000. Since of course the counter never goes below 0, this means in any given minuite there cant be more than m artillery set off, but note fractions do apply - an m of 2.5 will be rounded UP to 3 in the first minuite, but since the leftover msec is carried over, there will be only 2 allowed in the next minuite. Hence on average there can only be 2.5 artillery every minuite. It also means that once the counter has exceeded the cap, you dont have to wait a full minuite for it to count down, in order to fire artillery again.\r\n\r\nbq. btw Q for bani etc, in etpro does team_max~ overrule g_heavyweaponrestriction or vice versa, or be determined by whichever comes last?\r\n\r\nbq. Rain: g_heavyweaponsrestriction only controls airstrike/arty fire right now. We should probably move that into a team_* cvar as well, since to say the current usage of heavyweaponsrestriction with regards to airstrike/arty is not well understood would be an understatement.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n* http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22308\r\n* https://forums.splashdamage.com/t/heavy-weapons-restrictions-on-rtcw-et-servers-please-help/110465/2",
