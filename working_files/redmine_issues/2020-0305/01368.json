On oasis, towards the East. 3D model seems shifted towards the South.\r\n* Tank and fixed MG are unaffected.\r\n\r\nThis is an etmain bug! It has been fixed in etpro and nq. It is present in etpub and jaymod.\r\n\r\nEdit: cg.pmext.mountedWeaponAngles in CG_OffsetFirstPersonView() is not set correctly for followers.",
