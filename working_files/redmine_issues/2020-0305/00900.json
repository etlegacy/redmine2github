There is no way Debian could distribute this program in its free repository in the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nI have already created a working Debian package for ET: Legacy and I think it is eligible for inclusion into Debian's contrib section depending on the status of the etmain/* directory which is actually shipped with your source tarball from github.com. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy/archive/v2.74.tar.gz\r\n\r\nI have made a complete license check for all files included in this source tarball. Everything seems fine but I am unsure about the included etmain source folder. According to your license terms it should be covered by the GPL-3+ license. If this is not the case, I have to remove all files within it. You really should prominently  mention the original EULA terms in your source tarball releases. I am fully aware of that players still need pak0.pk3, pak1.pk3 and pak2.pk3. They are even worse than non-free because they are non-distributable for Debian but it is completely legal to download them from splashdamage.com. This can be easily done with Debian's game-data-packager from testing/sid by running\r\n\r\ngame-data-packager enemy-territory\r\n\r\nand by manually installing the resulting Debian package. \r\n\r\nIf I remove the complete etmain/* directory in your source tarball, the game fails to build from source. Is there a chance to provide the engine without those files or to work around this issue?",

I thought the original pak{0,1,2}.pk3 files were the only files needed to play the game and the rest was free software. But if you say that all files in\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy/tree/master/etmain\r\n\r\nare covered by the original EULA, then I can't even package the game for non-free because the EULA does not allow redistribution.
