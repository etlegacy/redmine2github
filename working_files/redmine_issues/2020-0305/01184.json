            "notes": "IIRC this is due to the limit of render commands, which is set to like *262144* commands, including both 2D and 3D draw commands, seems a big threshold to hit, but in case of menus and hud, each letter is a separate draw command, in case of menus it has to draw characters twice for the shadow effect, and so on. The  console is, obviously, rendered last, and it renders lines bottom up, hence, once it hits the limit it just drops the render commands. \r\nhttps://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy/blob/bba1b2a00ba8a525498fd12753f9b88b250ce0ba/src/renderer/tr_cmds.c#L157\r\n\r\nThere are several solutions to this problem, one is to increase the *MAX_RENDER_COMMANDS* constant, the other is to simplify the menus, for instance by removing the text shadows. One could also write a text baking algo to reduce the number of render commands, but that would require to extend trap system for ui and cgame.",
