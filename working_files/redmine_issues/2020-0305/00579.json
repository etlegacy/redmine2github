    "description": "Here's an example:\r\n\r\n1. I join Allies and it says: \"Saukko entered the game\"\r\n2. I join Axis from Allies and it says: \"Saukko entered the game\"\r\n\r\nSo the thing here is that it says it everytime you choose one of the teams, no matter what.\r\nMy suggestion is this:\r\n\r\n- When you join Axis it would say: \"Saukko has joined the Axis team\"\r\n- When you join Allies it would say: \"Saukko has join the Allied team\"\r\n\r\nBecause if it spams \"Saukko entered the game\" it doesn't provide that much information. And also it doesn't make sense that it says always \"entered the game\" when you just swap teams. So making some sort of tiny adjustment would make more sense than that.\r\n\r\n-*S",
