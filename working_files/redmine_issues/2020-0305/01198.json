            "notes": "Hello, if I may, my two cents, this isn't just concerns the server side. This, usually, also requires client side modification in order to implement feature correctly. You see, pretty much every implementation, apart from the lazy one used in provided lua script, requires a dedicated message space, which is usually a top part of the screen, and a dedicated server command \"bp\" sent to the client to display the message on that spot. You should of course be able to select the place banner is printed using the aforementioned cvar, but usually it would default to \"bp\", and be displayed on the top of the screen. This way messages printed using \"bp\", instead of \"cp\", are less distracting and could be disabled all along using client cvar. Hereby, I suggest to reopen the issue and actually implement it in the mod.",

I'd rather not have that in the code.\r\n\r\nLastly, I'm personally not a fan of banners in general (or watermark as implemented in some mods). To me, it's unecessary admin spam/ads that is better left outside the game. cp/cpm does also the job more than reasonably for in-game info.",

As for cp banners, what can be worse? Having continuously repetitive messages printed on the center of the screen, definitely not for me. This is why I think banners should be controlled and have proper default behavior and place to be displayed, something you won't achieve with WA alone.",

At least, using them as cp/cpm print force admins not using too much, or they become really annoying for players.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not strictly against adding a new print command - if (and only if) it does make sense somehow for the mod as a feature outside of abs/banners (but what?). Adding it just for the sake of displaying admin shit - no, I really don't want that. That's better left outside of Legacy mod.",

            "notes": "Well whether we like it or not, banners gonna exist. I guess to address that issue, whoever thought about it first, decided to make it less distracting yet visible for any new player, and created bp to draw it on top. To be clear it's not just etpro feature, other mods also have it, to name few - etpub, jaymod, etrun and etjump (all can be checked in source code), and I have no doubts any other popular mod has it too. This just became some sort of standard among mods, and I guess people and scripts kinda expect bp to be there too. In etpro, bp is also used to draw match information in ettv mode (and maybe in shoutcaster mode), like times teams have set finishing specific goals in sw. Pretty sure I saw lua scripts are using bp to draw different kind of information too, like sprees. I mean it's not just for banners only really. To make it more generic I would suggest to give it different name, but I don't really want to break the standard naming convention over here. \r\nAnd I think not doing anything and allow polluting cp and cpm isn't a solution to the problem here, but we don't have to invent a solution really, since people already invented, it and this is bp!\r\n\r\nP.s.
