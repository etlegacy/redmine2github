I said \"I need a medic.\" and then I noticed with 2 other clients that it showed wrong name in the chat. Also can confirm that there's no medic icon when an enemy in disguise is asking for medic unlike if a teammate would ask medic. So there are 2 issues here.\r\n\r\nIn 'Example 2' you can see that I took a suit with \"Saukko\" and it showed my name as \"Poika\" to the enemies. This is correct. But when I changed my colours with \"Poika\" it still shows the old colours in disguise to the other players.\r\n\r\n-*S",
