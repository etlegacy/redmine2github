This happens because the time_played variable should always been shorter than time played in axis + time played in allies teams, but it is not always reset correctly (unlike both time_axis and time_allies) for slow connecters, resulting in percentage bigger than 100%.\r\n\r\nThis is also visible in SW mode, second round (g_currentRound = 1) as stats are not reset between round (apart from XPs).\r\n\r\n",
