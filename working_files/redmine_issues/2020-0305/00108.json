I wasn't just sure about the switch in CG_EventHandling ... before we have had case 0/1 as input for that switch so the case of CGAME_EVENT_DEMO (f.e.) was never managed ...\n\nUpdate: There are also some if statements (line 950++) in that function which never got executed before ???\n\n-Update2: CG_EventHandling is mostly called with enum int but there is another case we have to check:-\n\n<pre>\n \tcase CG_EVENT_HANDLING:\n\t\tCG_EventHandling(arg0, qtrue);\n</pre>\n\n\n... let's discuss this on IRC ...",
