    "description": "I've taken the screenshots of player stats right there. So what I really would like to see is that that any stats you gain or get, shooting bullets or getting xp, the stats would update in real time. Currently when you first time press Alt (+stats) it will show for example you have no stats at first, no shots no xp. But then you hold Alt down and start shooting... The shots aren't registered into stats in real time. As soon as you don't press Alt any more and press it again, you see the stats coming there.\r\n\r\n-*S",
