Flags usually use a standard 2/3 ratio, with a few exceptions. I guess the original squared size are related to the fast inverse square root algorithm used by the engine.\r\n2/ Strict change from relative to absolute positions shouldn't affect anything, since the relative position are computed on a virtual 640x480 screen that is later scaled to the real sreen resolution. In that case, I did move the position a bit lower to avoid overlapping with obituaries.. which of course results with overlapping with the skill box on lower resolution :(\r\n\r\nIdeally, we might use some way to compute elements position from adjusted virtual resolution (not only 4:3, but also 5:4,16:9,16:10 ratio depending on the actual resolution).\r\n\r\nLast point: you might have seen that the font used by the obituaries box looks clearer, while most other fonts are blurry. This might be because the obituaries font itself doesn't seem to be scaled to a virtual resolution first (ETPub/Silent replaced the original blurry font rendering with that one).\r\n\r\nEdit: Revert the position changes in the meantime.",
