I attached two demos where you can hear referee whistle, vote bell, construction and wall breaking sounds when these sounds should not have been played.\r\n\r\nIf this is version incompatibility issue, I think a reasonable mitigation could be to add the version of the recording engine to the demo files and display it in the menu.",
