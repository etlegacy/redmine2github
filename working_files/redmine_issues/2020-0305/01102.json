    "subject": "movement glitch underneath Railgun cranes",
    "description": "When moving underneath the cranes in Railgun there is a weird stutter glitch, which is more obvious when jumping.\r\nIn the mapfile the only thing that is drawing attention is the \"misc_beam\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=misc_beam entity which is the rope of the crane. Personally, I have no experience with that entity and have also never seen it before, so my only guess is, that the movement glitch is related to the misc_beam entity.\r\n\r\n\"Video\":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHwGIsv2MUg\r\n\r\nThe setup is the following:\r\nWe have crane2_hook which is a script_mover and only the hook. \r\nThen there is crane2 which is also a script_mover and the sled everything is mounted on.\r\nThe connection is a misc_beam entity which has message/crane2 and target/crane2_hook as key/value pairs and the rope as shader.",
