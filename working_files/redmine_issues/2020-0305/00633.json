What is weird is that this commit is actually the \"correct\" one (in an academic sense), so there might be some other intentional bug introduced somewhere to \"counterfix\" this one.\r\n\r\nEdit: Confirmed, this is the responsible commit. Now reverted by IR4.\r\nEdit2: DIsregard the above comment. I'm not sure why I saw some errors while the TransposeMatrix code was cleaned, since I cannot find anything relevant anymore. My bad :/",

    "description": "I found a couple of places where I could reproduce this. I took a demo in Fueldump to show what this bug is and screenshots in Railgun too.\r\nThe demo shows, what happens when you go in front of the tank. You can't see anything and it will only go away when you \\kill yourself.\r\nThe screenshots were taken before I ever tried Fueldump. This happened at the specfic spot. First I was in front of the carriage. At once when I jumped on top of it, my screen went grey, and when I moved backwards I could get the grey screen off. The third screenshot is to show from the enemy point of view what is happening. But if I just had demo you could see the guy disappearing and then appearing all over again.\r\n\r\nI will try to provide a demo of the Railgun case.\r\n\r\n-*S",
