See if Condorcet is worth implementing\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible to vote multiple time by disconnecting and reconnecting in debriefing. This should be fixed.\r\n\r\n> One option if you guys can fix it i.e. players can vote /reconnect vote again and pump up the votes for 1 map. If that can be resolved, it would be great. I haven't tried similar behavior on ETL mod yet but I believe it exist in various other mods. Thanks!",

    "description": "In MavVote gametype, when g_mapvoteflags 4 is set, it is possible to vote for multiple maps. The first map gets 3 votes, the 2nd 2 votes, the third 1 vote only.\r\nIt is however possible to cast all 6 votes on 1 map. This has been refered as the \"Putin simulator\".\r\n\r\nInstead, prevent the vote to be cast on a single map. This would result in implementing the \"Condorcet method\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method, which is much better!",
