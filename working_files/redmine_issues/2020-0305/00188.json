There is more terrain on pic 1.2 and the tower on right side reduces VIS a lot (see lights from buildings) = more fps. If you watch the wall of 1st building in the background the wall is more detailed in 1 = less fps.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter in which part of the map I was. Everywhere I had 70-90 FPS with the latest build of ET:L but with the previous one 125 FPS all the time. The best think is that I was using quake3.exe (renamed etl.exe) which gives me extra 20-30 FPS on every map. Now I use these files from Rafal and soon I will comapre the results.\r\n\r\nMateos wrote:\r\n> You just need a good CPU, but for Vanilla only the GHz counts.

In other words: 2.70rc1 doesn't process map lightmaps. It's just the same as removing map/<MAPNAME>/lm_00XXX.tga files from a map (pk3) using lightmaps.\r\nI did set the lighmap loading path to a bogus value in the current code and got a difference about +30 fps at my test position with same viewangel on bremen_final.\r\n\r\nTest this: \r\n\r\n./etl +devmap bremen_final\r\nr_lightmap 1\r\n\r\nwith rc1 and current code and you'll see the fixed bug\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
