    "description": "There is a time offset between what the reinforcement timer displays to the player and what the real reinforcement timer is.\r\n\r\nAs an example, on a 30 seconds reinforcement map, the player will not reinforce when the timer reaches zero, but some other constant value (like 7s, or 13s). Bots seems however aware of this time offset and tap out right before the \"real\" timer.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been confirmed by RaFal on irc. I cannot reproduce it on RC3, so it seems this regression has been introduced recently.",
