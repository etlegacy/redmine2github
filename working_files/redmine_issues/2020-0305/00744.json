    "description": "As the title says. These weapons are the same but the scopes differ them from each other. Still these weapons work in a very different way. Scoped version deals more damage and should be separated from the normal rifle. So it would work in a way that covert op has his \"own\" gun and the engineer would have his \"own\" gun. Meaning f.e. that the K43 stats wouldn't be all the same with engineer and covert op they would count as different weapons.\r\n\r\n-*S",
