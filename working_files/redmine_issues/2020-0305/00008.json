What i remember from back then is this:\r\n\r\n1) server receives download request; something like wwwdl <filename>\r\n2) server checks file and kicks the client if filename not present\r\n3) server notifies all connected clients about kick and kickreason\r\n\r\nIf <filename> bigger ~1024, you get problems on point 3, provided the server allows to send out messages bigger 1024 bytes. This was the fix described above. However, when the server lets the message through, client has to handle it. As far as i remember the client tries to print out something bigger 1024 bytes to his console, and this crashes him.\r\n\r\nServer remains unaffected at all times it seems.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation: remove the line (fix from above) and attack your own server with a script something like \"wwwdl <veryhugefilename>\". With the line removed all connected clients should be kicked. Then you go from there. Check which command is affected in client side and if it is not affecting performance too much, then i would add a check for size there, if possible. But if the fix needs for example a check on every frame, i wouldn't care, because the server i connect is the server i am trusting.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, as long as the server does not let the message through, everything is fine :) But i could be wrong.\r\n\r\n-acqu",
