This seems to be related to weapon slot as suggested by IR4.\r\n\r\nETPub: completely broken. Disabling \"cg_panzerhack\" (Thomson/MP40 in slot 3 only, not 2) makes it less broken.\r\nSilent: They allow another Thomson/MP40 by default, not concerned by this issue.\r\nNQ: Use browning/Stgw44 instead, not concerned by this issue.\r\n\r\nEdit: The issue with non soldier players described above is now fixed. The bug is now only related to Soldier with HW lvl 4. ",
