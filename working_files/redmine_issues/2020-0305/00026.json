            "notes": "It is possible but my first thought and we should keep this in mind: if you do a cvar for this (depending on the mod) admins might abuse it by forcing this cvar. I haven't tested the cases of forcing cvars with different cvarFlags but I do assume if you deny changes here the client/player is also no longer able to do easy updates. A config file might be an option but this is not a big deal to manipulate as well if you compile mod code and use a static file name. I don't think the URLs of master servers will change a lot in future so just adding both current master servers might do the trick.  ",
