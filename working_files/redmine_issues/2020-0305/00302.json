What I'm trying to explain is that, would you put your best killer to make an objective when the player who is good at killing could stay in the battlefield and keep killing? Anyway I gave a small example on my first post. You need to see the whole situation in gameplay to justify would the feature be handy or not. Sometimes I have seen people teamkilling own teammates to get the objective. Is that true teamplay then?\r\n\r\nBut since majority seems to be against the feature, the game shall remain as it is then.\r\n\r\n-*S",

Obviously, you can't see the icon above the head of player when the player isn't in sight (behind a wall, inside a building, etc.), and the icon isn't visible on map either if the player isn't in the line of sight of a friendly coverops. If the player himself is hidden behind some boxes, and isn't visible apart from the objective icon.. wouldn't this be a buggy behavior? This would be a per-client change only, although I don't know if that would be worth implementing.\r\n",
