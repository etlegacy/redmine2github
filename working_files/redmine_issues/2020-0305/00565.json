    "description": "How to reproduce this:\r\n\r\n1. Take engineer\r\n2. Plant dynamite near objective\r\n3. Go to spectators\r\n\r\nThis causes a few things to happen. First of all, the objective you planted dynamite at, will explode. The second thing which it will cause, you won't get any xp of the objective you destroyed.  Also you won't get any xp of the enemies while they get killed by the dynamite. But still it will show that YOU killed the player with the dynamite even you weren't in the team, you were as spectator.\r\n\r\nI don't know to which way this should be fixed. Make dynamites disappear when you go to spectator or then make dynamites gain the xp of all the kills and objectives it destroys. To me it would be most logical to make dynamites disappear when you go to spectators or are put there.\r\n\r\n-*S",
