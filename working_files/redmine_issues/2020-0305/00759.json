You might get the point by checking the screenshot.\r\n\r\nI don't know is it happening only with the localhost games but these things I noticed:\r\n* You can only freeze yourself or ALL the players\r\n* You can't freeze one single player\r\n* When everyone will be frozen, only the one making the freeze will recieve the \"You are frozen\" message\r\n* When server host freezes ownself many times in a row, he will get the \"You are frozen\" message all the time and also console gets spammed with \"<name> is frozen.\"\r\n\r\nThese are all I found out for now. It needs a bit more improvements.\r\n\r\n-*S",
