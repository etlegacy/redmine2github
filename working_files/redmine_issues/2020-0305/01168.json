            "notes": "The ability of full gibbing with knife is related to covert ops skill \"Assassin\" when knife attacks are done from behind. It doesn't matter which class is selected but If this skill isn't reached the damage Impact of a target player is about 104 HP. The old code did allow these attacks only when the target player HP was below 0.\r\n\r\nI've changed the code so there is an 'instagib' of wounded players when the skill is reached - otherwise the damage is still about 104 HP.\r\nIt's one good more reason to play the covert ops and reaching the skill. \r\n\r\n\r\nSide notes: Covert ops knife damage for common hits is multiplied by 2. The damage of knife has a tiny random add of max. 4 HP for all hits.\r\n",

    "description": "Fast gibbing with knife is one of the most essential and desirable features in competitive play - it allows to eliminate wounded player from game fast and without wasting ammunition (of course by switching to knife, the player lets his guard down and exposes himself to other players, so it might be as well a double-edged sword). Moreover, it would complement the longer forcing into limbo with SMG, balancing the gibbing in general. \r\n\r\nDiscussion on discord and conclusions drawn from legacy competitive test matches indicate that there is a general desire for adding instant gibbing with knife from behind wounded player.
