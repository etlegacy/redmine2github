V or any other binded key for the quick message window, should close menu if you are in the \"main window\" in hierarchy, otherwise it should put you back to \"main window\" level, as it does right now. I had caught myself on the same idea several times, when i would press \"v\" accidentally (or not) and trying to hit escape to close it - is not an option. For instance, if i would be moving in some direction, and would not want to take the fingers off wasd to reach the escape button. But taking into account how the menus are implemented i can guess that's not the cleanest task to accomplish.",

            "notes": "Obviously, it doesn't make sense to have the voice-chat close with the same key, because those are letters and you write in the chat box also with those letters.\r\nIn the case of the quick-chat menu, there is nothing that button could possibly do in that situation. We are highly unlikely to mess up configs, we are not changing the current behaviour, since ESC will still close it. All I'm suggesting is to *additionally* give \"V\" the function to close the menu. If people are used to ESC, then they can still press ESC. I can honestly can not see *any* harm in this. \"V\" opens the menu, you can press \"V\" to step-back inside the menu and in my opinion it would be nice to be able to also close the menu with \"V\". *Nothing is changing, no configs are being destroyed, no habits are broken.* \r\n\r\nKey-consistency:\r\nPress \"L\" to open Limbo menu, press \"L\" to close Limbo menu.\r\nPress \"Esc\" to open main menu, press \"Esc\" to close main menu.\r\nPress \"Ctrl\", \"Alt\", \"...\" to open one of those weird things, release \"Ctrl\", \"Alt\", \"...\" to close one of the weird things.\r\nPress \"Tab\" to open the Team overview, release \"Tab\" to close the Team overview.\r\nPress \"G\" to open the map, release \"G\" to close the map.\r\n\r\nThey *all* open and close with the same key. Whether it's a key-press or key-hold doesn't really matter. There is absolutely no case where you can't close a menu (not chat-box) by pressing the same key again that opened it. So your argument of key-consistency is actually in favour of having \"V\" close that menu.\r\n",

            "notes": "I'd like to add that, for instance, V doesn't behave as step back in voice chat menu, but rather it just restarts the voice chat window, i believe they never bothered to fix that, as unlike the limbo and other in-game windows kemon has listed (that are cgame windows), voice chat works from ui module, which makes it hard to implement desired behavior in a clean way, but that's just my guess. I'd like to have exception for voice chats, more over i am pretty sure i will add such behavior in etjump, it's especially quite useful while jumping. Would be cool if you could implement smart step-back system for some menus, without editing the menu files it self (to remain consistent with vanilla menus and such). Also the behavior could be optional and work through cvar.",

But if there are actual limits in the UI setup that's something else. Although it really has to be a completely mad system if it wouldn't allow something like that. Anyway, in my opinion this isn't worth if it should actually require the implementation of yet another cvar. Like I said, current habits and configs would remain unaffected.",
