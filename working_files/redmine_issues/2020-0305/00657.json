            "notes": "I just think that it's not much of a major loss if the engineer can't get his xp from damaging his own MG.\r\nYou don't need to prevent engineer repairing the MG he damaged himself, but to prevent the xp gain if he was the one damaging it. Though then we could go deeper that there are two pariticipants abusing this. That your teammate damages the MG and then you repair the MG to get the xp. So whenever a teammate or you damage the MG, you can't gain XP from repairing it. So the only way to gain that 3 extra xp is that an enemy damages the MG and you will repair it after that.\r\n\r\n-*S",
