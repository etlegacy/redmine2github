I don't know is that a covert op's feature to see the other one from own spawn in his own spawn. But I took plenty of screenshots. I wanted to see is this map specific. I have no slightest idea how command map supposed to work. But currently it's bugged, somehow. See the screenshots.\r\n\r\nThere are also those other issue tickets I have posted here, I will try to link those to this.\r\n\r\n-*S",
