Healing syringes and adrenaline syringes share the ammo count, since they are the very same thing (medics lvl4 only earn the ability to inject it to themselves, see #676). Moreover, using adrenaline has a \"cost\", since you'll have one less teammate to revive.\r\n\r\nImho, we should make this feature optional, with a cvar and/or Lua.",
