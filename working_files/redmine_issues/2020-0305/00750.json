With the default 0.8 value, the commander voice volume is all right, but when set to a lower value (f.e. 0.25) it is too low compared to other \"effects\" sounds.\r\n\r\nOn a sidenote, the music volume (s_musicvolume) is highly dependent on the s_volume slider too. If s_volume is set to 0.8, then s_musicvolume set to 0.25 means \"set music to 25% of the 0.8 sound volume\".",
