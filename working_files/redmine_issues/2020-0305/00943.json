It looks a bit silly.\r\n\r\nWhat we'd need is a way to check the actual depth of water. The waterlevel variable just tells about the location of the model relatively to the water (1 means feet in water, 2 means can stand with head above water, and 3 means completely underwater).\r\n\r\nEdit: should now be fixed.",
