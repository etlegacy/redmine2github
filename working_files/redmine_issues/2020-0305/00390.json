    "subject": "Add constructible XP sharing",
    "description": "\"When multiple engineers help build a constructible, each gets his share of XP once the constructible is build. The share of gained XP is proportional to how much the engineer built.\"\r\n\r\nETPub introduces g_constructibleXPSharing for this, but I don't think a new cvar is needed. After all, I can't imagine a situation were people would prefer to have the current behavior instead (except for stealing XP of teammates). This feature is more a bugfix than a feature, so I'd suggest to implement it by default.",
