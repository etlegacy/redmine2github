This might also be important in case we ever go standalone.-\r\nTracked in #1332.\r\n\r\n* -replace logo in UI (limbo panel, image preview in server browser...)-\r\n* -keep the Axis flag for now. While it could be replaced by a generic Axis logo, it might be bad to lose the \"Wolf\" feeling entirely.-\r\n* -keep the WolfET logo somewhere in credits? We actually never mention ETL is based on WolfET source code...-\r\n* -update the legalities to include Zenimax (which acquired Id Software in 2009), see https://splashdamage.com/legal/- (done)",
