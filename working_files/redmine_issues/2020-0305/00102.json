    "description": "As IPv4 depletion advances, after APNIC and recently European RIPE run dry it becomes a concern to provide abilities of replacing it IP version 6 protocol.\r\nWe need full client, server and master servers support for both single and dual-stack configurations, servers using two (or more?) addresses simultaneously supplying interoperability of v4 and v6 clients, without breaking 2.60b compatibility - where possible. Adequatly activation of curl IPv6 support for game data retrieving.\r\nIt is desirable to comply with current as well as emerging computing trends and networking standards whenever possible.\r\n\r\nHerewith I hope my humble recourse will meet with positive response, and - of course - with smirk on readers face }:->\r\n\r\nsalute morsik",
