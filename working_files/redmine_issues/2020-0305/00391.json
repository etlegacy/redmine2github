It is, however, not always permanent - it is temporarily replaced when the coverops ask for ammo/medipack, or when the player is saying something (\"!\" icon). I'm not sure if adding code to show all icons at the same time is really required. NQ does it because coverops can talk to the enemy team, but for legacy this seems a bit overkill. What do you think guys?\r\n\r\nNote that the red 'No shoot' icon is still present when aiming at the coverops - no change here.",

You continue to fight, looking for more enemies, and the now disguised coverops enter your field of view. You aim and shoot one or two bullets, before realizing that poor old guy is on your side when the \"no shoot\" icon appears.\r\n\r\nThe idea of this feature is to add a permanent icon above friendly disguised coverops, to avoid this situation (done this way in NQ, if I'm not wrong).",
