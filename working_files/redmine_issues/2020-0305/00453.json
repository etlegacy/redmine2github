I did later test later on, and realized that the fired shots counter isn't always wrong - sometimes it is fully correct, most of the time is it almost accurate, and in some cases it is plain wrong. I'm now also unsure if this has been fixed in NQ/ETPub or not.\r\n\r\nThe case depicted in the screenshot was a single, long flamethrower 'shot' (probably more than half a tank, or 100+ flame 'bullets') that did 5 kills in a row, and also killed myself.\r\n",
