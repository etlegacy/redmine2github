I specifically noticed some FG42 sounds being dropped.  And getting more into the \"big picture\" ... I guess the limit is just there because MAX_CHANNELS is 96.  With allowed = 8, that means you might run out of channels with more than 12 people nearby.  (And then fewer people if we increase it some more.)\r\n\r\nBut looking at the GPL code it looks like they used a different fix for ET.  There are added code blocks starting on lines 753, 772, 818, and 837, plus some other stuff sprinkled in here and there.  These basically have the engine make more of an effort to re-use sound channels allocated earlier, when there are a bunch of sounds coming from one entity (which apparently happens when shooting an smg).",

    "description": "I'm using Windows 8 Pro, and have confirmed this bug in both the 2.70rc1 client and the latest build.  An SMG fired by someone else will often only make a noise for some of the shots.  It might make a noise for three shots, then be silent for three shots, and then repeat.  (This can be extremely disorienting.)\r\n\r\nI can \"fix\" the issue by editing snd_dma.c, lines 614 and 618.  That seems to only allow 4 sounds to play at a time, or 8 in some cases, by setting a variable named 'allowed' to either 4 or 8.  I changed these values to 8 and 16, respectively.  But I do not understand how this fits into the big picture, so it is possible that it should be revised in some other way.\r\n\r\nI asked for confirmation in the IRC channel, but nobody else (whether using Windows or not) could confirm the bug.  I do not think the OS would matter, but maybe it does not affect other operating systems if they use OpenAL instead of DMA.",
