When you spectate somebody during the warmup and then the map starts and the player you spectated is far away from the spectators' starting location, the \"FIGHT!\" sound can't be heard. It all depends how far the spectated player is away from the spectators' starting location. The sound will gain more volume the closer it gets to the starting location.",
