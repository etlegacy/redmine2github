I'm using a GTX 780 Ti and have to use this or my FPS will be in the 50s and 60s and unstable. As soon as I set /r_primitives to 2, my FPS becomes a solid 100 again. For some reason I just started my game and suddenly it had horrible FPS, I hadn't even updated the driver or changed anything. I went to bed the night before, woke up and when I came on the computer I went to play ET and the FPS was poor. \r\n\r\nCurrent NVIDIA Driver: 347.25 (also occured on last couple drivers)\r\nVideo card: http://www.evga.com/products/Specs/GPU.aspx?pn=88601331-dbce-436d-8eb3-37f1f63b6745",
