I guess the cg_allowGeoIP isn't set client side when connecting, so they appear as \"UN\" flag (latest `else` catched it, so client->sess.uci = 246;). After a reconnect, everything should be in order. Maybe there is a way to correctly handle this use case, but this would be a temporary issue, and should be gone once players upgrade to the newer release.",
