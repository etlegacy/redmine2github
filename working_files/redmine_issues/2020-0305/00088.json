There are enough many translations for that word. It would be nice to know does it mean the final \"SCORE\", the current \"SCORE\" or a point \"SCORE\" f.e. 1-0?\r\n- Translation for \"You swapped places with\"? This is at the moment impossible to translate in Finnish if there is no object to whom swapping is concentrated in. The traslation to Finnish would be \"Vaihdoit paikkaa pelaajan [player name] kanssa\". There is no other way to translate the English sentence. So is there a posibility to add something to make my translation possible?\r\n- The context for \"Press '%s' for YES, or '%s' for No\"? This is an easy one to translate. If this is about voting, then the translation is easy. Well it would be anyway.\r\n- The contexts for \"Bonus Life! Deploying in %d seconds\" and \"No more deployments this round\"? Does it mean that some sort of object will be deploying? Or There will be no more some object? I never seen these in-game so it is difficult to know the meaning. ;)\r\n- The context for \"ROUND\"? Well there are only two translations I could come up with. I open this with an example: It lasts always the same amount of time f.e. 10 minutes. And the other one: Doesn't always last the same amount of time.\r\n\r\nHope to get some answers. :>\r\n\r\nEDIT: And I noticed that some of German translations are in Italian. I guess somebody could check those then?\r\n\r\n-*S",
