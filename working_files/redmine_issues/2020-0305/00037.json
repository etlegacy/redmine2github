The engine basically expects the string from ui code, so it is probably more appropriate to have the fix in ui. The places to go for here are in UI_StartServerRefresh, and there you need to change this\r\n\r\n@trap_Cmd_ExecuteText( EXEC_APPEND, va( \"globalservers %d %s\\n\", 0, ptr));\r\ntrap_Cmd_ExecuteText( EXEC_APPEND, va( \"globalservers %d %d\\n\", 0, (int)trap_Cvar_VariableValue( \"protocol\" ) ) );@\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n@trap_Cmd_ExecuteText( EXEC_APPEND, va( \"globalservers %d %s empty full\\n\", 0, ptr));\r\ntrap_Cmd_ExecuteText( EXEC_APPEND, va( \"globalservers %d %d empty full\\n\", 0, (int)trap_Cvar_VariableValue( \"protocol\" ) ) );@\r\n\r\nthis.

            "notes": "For note 1: 2.6b serverlist lists curretnly about 1000 servers. 2.55 even less :P. So i think this is not a problem, because et is dying anyways and only devs and hardcore gamers remain, which will probably never in future reach 4000+ servers. I think there is even a backup method, at least i can remember i saw it somewhere. Full servers should be listed as well, no need to hide information if there is not a really good reason. E.g. battlefield 3 game browser lists also full servers, why would he not list them O_O\r\n\r\nFor note 2. Hard one, and this won't be my decision :P I think i would leave it like it is and assume a mature game user :P",

    "description": "The current id masterserver has options to which it replies, e.g. \"getservers %s\", where %s is the protocol, e.g. 84. Sending him just that, will make him reply with a reduced set of servers, i.e. you will get only those not totally empty/not totally full. However, id masterserver has also the following option:\r\n\r\n@getservers %s empty full@\r\n\r\nSending him that, will make him reply with (to my knowledge) full masterlist. I found out about this, when i studied replies from ms. There were only 400 servers i got on each request. After changing the getservers request i got slightly above 1000 (protocol 84). Almost half the list was not send.\r\n\r\nCurrent et client 2.6b and also etlegacy do just send the reduced string. For receiving full masterlist the following needs to be changed in CL_GlobalServers_f:\r\n\r\n@sprintf(command, \"%s %s empty full\", cmdname, Cmd_Argv(2));@",
