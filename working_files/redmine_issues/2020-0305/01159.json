See if this is possible easily without the need to refactoring the whole weapon slot code. If the required work is too big, delay again - we should avoid to break everything now that we've stabilized the weapon code.",

This is not always desired, since some players bind weapon bank 3 to make sure they hold their main weapon. Moreover, since this action cannot be cancelled, it can be hard on you mid-fight.",
