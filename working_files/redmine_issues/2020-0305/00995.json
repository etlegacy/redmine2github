These are thin bars (first picture) and follow the splines in the second picture individually. Jusst like the tank does. That is why the gate has a nice curve. Of course this also means that the outer side of the curve will have horrible gaps, but the mappers conveniently sealed of that area so you don't see that^^\r\n\r\nThe script movers are called \"tbdoor\", so maybe you'll have luck finding that in the entity list.\r\n\r\nI know that you count all the entities in a map and believe me, you do not want to now the absolute number of entities those two gates require :D",
