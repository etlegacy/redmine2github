Or that could be done in a Legacy mod fork by a team that has resources to focus on these fun features.",

If you add this then we will next add double jumping \"because we already have feature x\". I am still  against any of \"public only\" random features, because then I wont know what sort of experience I am getting from a server even tho it is a legacy server. This kick stuff is really mild modification, its just that it is totally useless and as such random feature. \r\n\r\nIf someone want's random 'fun' stuff in ET then there's NQ/Silent/Nitmod etc etc, but this is just my opinion..",
