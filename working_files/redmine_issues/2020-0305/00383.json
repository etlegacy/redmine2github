I'll close this issue because from my current experience it would be better to make the mapping tool select only the required files and start ET:L with a homepath containing only those files. I might change this opinion after I get more experience in mapping and then reopen this issue, but we'll see.",

It would make life easier for modders and mappers imo.\r\n",
