    "subject": "Dying by own construction doesn't always show the skull in yellow",
    "description": "As the title says. I found out that the skull wasn't 100% of the time in yellow when you selfkill by getting crushed by own construction. In stats it shows it was a selfkill. (See the screenshot attached)\r\nBut how I think it causes to be white then. I have taken a demo where it's white. I was also able to find out the possible reason for what's the reason for this. There's this MG near Allies first spawn in Railgun. So here's how to reproduce the white skull (same as shown in the demo):\r\n1. Go to the MG\r\n2. Construct it while being in middle of the MG gun\r\n3. Construction done (you died and it shows as white and selfkill got counted in stats)\r\n\r\nBut how to make this yellow then? Follow these steps:\r\n1. Go to the MG\r\n2. Construct the MG but make sure you don't hit the MG but the sandbags that are around the gun itself\r\n3. Construction successful (it shows as yellow and also shows as selfkill in the stats)\r\n\r\n-*S",
