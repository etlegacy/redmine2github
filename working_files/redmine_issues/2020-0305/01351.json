            "comments": "general: fix engine crash on 64bit systems, refs #1351 #1211 #1089\n\nEngine was crashing on startup on 64 bit systems on Release builds.\n\nIt was happening due to SSE optimizations taking place, yielded by the\ncompiler on default settings (ETLegacy does not specify any optimization\nflags by default). Most specifically the \"movaps\" instruction was failing\nbecause it could not null several structure fields (in token_t) at once,\nbecause it could not operate properly on Z_Malloc'ed memory block, as the\ninstruction requires a 16 byte boundary alignments, where Z_Malloc only does\n4/8 byte paddings (depending on the system). The token_t alignment was 16 byte\ndue to the usage of \"long double\" type on \"floatvalue\" field, which is\nextraordinarily big, even though on the 32bit systems it still occupies\n12bytes, the struct alignment stays within 4 bytes, because the type is\nnon-atomic. The token_t \"floatvalue\" and \"intvalue\" now matching the\n\"pc_token_t\" field types, as this makes more sense, since \"pc_token_t\" is the\nstructure used to receive \"token_t\" values on the mod side.\n\n* fixed botlib token_t alignment, was breaking sse optimization (causing\nthe crash)\n* shut some botlib warnings",

Only Steam and Lutris have 32bit support at the moment, but I do see your concern in regards to 32bit mods. I've little sympathy to closed source 32bit mods, but if 32bit is the only thing that compiles, then I'll take it :D",

    "description": "Over at Flathub.org, there is a small project going on to get all classic Id titles packaged for Flatpak. Multiple Doom-engines has been released, Quake 1 and 2 are in review, and I've been working on RTCW and ET:L\r\nhttps://github.com/flathub/flathub/issues/1160\r\n\r\nET:Legacy is almost completely working, which would mean that it could become available for all Linux users on all distributions. There is only one thing holding the distribution back. I get a segmentation fault on start-up, and I'm not skilled enough in C and the fine workings of ET:L to get this sorted.\r\n\r\nSo really, I'm just asking here upstream if anybody could look into the cause of this crash. It might be something minor that we could easily fix in the Flatpak, but it would mean that the path is clear for publishing ET:Legacy to a wide variety of Linux distributions.\r\n\r\nCurrent development branch were I'm working on:\r\nhttps://github.com/Eonfge/flathub/tree/com.etlegacy.ETL\r\nIf you clone it and run the shell script, things should guide themselves from there.",
