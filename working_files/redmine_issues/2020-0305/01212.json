I don't understand the complaints from people saying it's \"loud\" and \"cheesy\", but these issues might be due to using SDL2 - I have been using OpenAL as my backend of choice for a long time now. Test and investigate with SDL2 backend.",

It's an original sound file from etmain's pak0.pk3. \r\nsound\\weapons\\garand\\m1_grenade_fly.wav\r\nsound\\weapons\\k43\\k43_grenade_fly.wav\r\nMost likely the original developers decided on not using it after all for the same reason we're complaining about. It's nost just annoying but also a cheesy sound effect. Later mods like ETPub which Legacy is based on must've decided to reintroduce it if it wasn't somebody from Legacy.",
