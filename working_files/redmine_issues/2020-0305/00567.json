ET:L crashes and my desktop's brightness goes brighter. This happens whenever ET:L crashes.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain but this might have happened with some specific games only. Not all the games have this problem when they crash. It's a rare issue but it's rather annoying because it's way too bright and it goes away only by restarting the computer.\r\n\r\n-*S",
