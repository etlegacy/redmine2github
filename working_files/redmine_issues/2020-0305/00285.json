Now, when Unlagged is running, full compensation or not, the built-in lag is taken care of completely. There goes one reason. It also does every hit test based on what players _see_ rather than what's actually _happening_, so the second reason isn't any longer valid either.\r\n>\r\n> It does have some detrimental effects:\r\n>\r\n> - More incoming bandwidth is required of players\r\n> - cl_timenudge can't extrapolate as much, meaning it's less effective (this becomes an issue when sv_fps is over 33)\r\n> - Higher pings (it seems the client engine holds onto snapshots a little longer)\r\n> - Other players may be \u201cjerkier\u201d since more samples mean less smoothing in general\r\n> - The new skip correction becomes less effective\r\n> \r\n> So no, I wouldn't advise higher server framerates. There aren't any advantages anymore, and there are plenty of disadvantages.\r\n\r\nMaybe legacy mod just needs \"Unlagged\" so the whole thing with sv_fps would be invalid?",
