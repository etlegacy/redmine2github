Do we want to change this? Play the same sound on resuming?\r\n\r\n2.) This ticket was created because of sound issues at start of constructing reported by player at our last release gaming session. Last night I did run into same. This occures when the connection is just bad (ping > 350 and higher, flickering 'connection interrupted' message is shown) .  I did connect to an australian server from europe. In fact I've had more issues than this missing construction sound: The game feels delayed in total which isn't a real surprise ...\r\n\r\n",

We can add such a call for legacy mod & engine but this results in 2.60 client incompatibility -> \"Bad cgame system trap\". ... so let the mod only do it for legacy clients only?
