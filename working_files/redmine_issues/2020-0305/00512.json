            "notes": "To me this is not a bug but an element of the game, you should not pick up weapons if you have over 30 ammo as theres a risk of you losing a lot of your stash. Some mods have implemented this and i agree that theres a plus but if \"fixed\" this should be behind a cvar (ex g_saveAmmo).",

            "notes": "Agree, this should be made optional.\r\n\r\nAlso, clips aren't directly part of weapon, unless they are loaded in it. If a \"dropweapon\" option is implemented in the future, the most logical way of handling clip would be that they are stored with the player, not the weapon. Dropping your weapon and all the weapon clips at the same time seems buggy to me.\r\n\r\nEdit: Beside this, my main gried about dropping all the clip when you died is the fact that it is way easier to pick up a lot of ammo on the ground, thus lessening the team dependency between you and the field ops (ie, this is a major gameplay change imho).",
