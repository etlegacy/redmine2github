Hopefully that is called somewhere in the code.\r\nI found a sprites/smokepuff shader in _unsorted.shader, but it doesn't seem the be that one.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know how that is handled in the code, but if it is a shader like any other thrn my best guess would be to include a \"sort\":http://q3map2.robotrenegade.com/docs/shader_manual/general-directives.html#sort shader parameter.",
