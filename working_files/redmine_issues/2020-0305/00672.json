    "description": "So having ^ in the end of your name has some slight issues. Only places where it shows correctly are game options and limbo menu. For example I have set my name as \"boi^\" but after renaming, console shows that I changed my name into \"boi\". When hovering my cursor with another client over the player, it shows as \"boi\" instead of \"boi^\". \\players show it as \"boi\" and the list goes on. And using \\dumpuser needs the whole name \"boi^\" and since it's not shown for the server host, he might not know about that ^ which he can't see.\r\n\r\nThere's also one case where you can see the whole name \"boi^\" when you get kicked by too many complaints. Then it's shown. (see the screenshot).\r\n\r\n-*S",
