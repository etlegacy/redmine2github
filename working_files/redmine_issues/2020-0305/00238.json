To much coding work to prevent that someone has to write max 4 numbers into the console.\r\n\r\nI think you did not get the point here what I was going after. It is not about the value of the CVAR, it is the CVAR itself. In the picture is the result I pressed TAB, it just shows the possibilities with com_m and there are two of those: com_maxfps and com_minimized. In the original ET, at least in NQ mod, when you type com_m and press TAB after, it will scroll through the possibilities. First it types automatically com_minimized and when you press TAB again it will give you com_maxfps. Then when you hit space on the CVAR you want to use, you could just enter the value.",
