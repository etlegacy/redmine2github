The view is \"locked\" on the next player so it can successfully resume once the spectated player is back in the game.\r\nI usually press spacebar to unlock the view, then process as usual to follow someone else. It's definitively not ideal though. If someone has a better implementation to suggest, I'll take it.\r\n\r\nAlso: welcome back!",
