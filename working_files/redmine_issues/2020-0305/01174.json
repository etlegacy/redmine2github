    "description": "Discussion between players resulted in the conclusion that currently the healing of wounded players is too hard, as players very frequently fail to heal, in situations when they feel they should succeed. Players often have to try 2-3 times before finally the syringe hits the hitbox. Coupled with the long syringe hit interval, it leads to situation when one dies too often when trying to heal wounded players. \r\n\r\nNow, I wasn't able to check ETPro's hitboxes, I didn't find a CVAR for it (g_debugbullets 8 only works for body hitbox for players alive), so I don't know the exact height of ETPro's hitbox, probably they are the same as vanilla (?). But since afaik legacy is not aiming to be 1:1 ETPro's copy, maybe the height could be increased just slightly, say to 150% of current height. This would make healing with syringe easier and at the same time the size of the hitbox would be still reasonable. ",
