            "notes": "Hello muessli, you are trying host game using test mod releases you have fetched from the TM server, these release packages contain more recent cgame and ui modules, but they don't contain a very crucial module to make things running, an up to date qagame.dll, as this one is hosted only on TM server. You are seeing an error simply because v2.76 qagame (that is loaded, as you only have this one) is not compatible with aforementioned pk3s. You will be able to host game, if you remove the packages.

But unfortunately you can't host a server having these packages downloaded, since these are test builds anyways and they break the ability to host servers right now, which is unfortunate, but there is own logic behind it. \r\n\r\nYou have only three options basically: \r\n* remove packages and host the server as clean legacy v2.76 (which is something you don't want to do if you play often online)\r\n* wait for an official v2.77 release (and basically don't host local games)\r\n* change homepath, to host v2.76 in a clean environment (make shortcut and set arguments like this +set fs_homepath \"C:\\\\ETLegacy-v276\"), which is preferable, but would require to setup config again\r\n\r\nFuture versions of engine, will hopefully handle these situations in a better manner, by not breaking the abilities to play locally even if you have test builds installed without important module.\r\n\r\n",
