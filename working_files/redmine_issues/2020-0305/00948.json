            "notes": "Okay, so for existing power-up items (health/ammo pack, cold_meal, weapons, etc) the sound is hard-coded and can't be changed easily? \r\n\r\nThat actually makes sense, because they always look and behave the same way, so they can also sound the same. But would it be possible to add that feature for \"trigger_heal\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=trigger_heal and \"trigger_ammo\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=trigger_ammo ? These are necessary for \"health\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=misc_cabinet_health and \"ammo\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=misc_cabinet_supply cabinets for example, basically always, when the player isn't picking up a power-up. When the player enters that trigger he automatically picks up health or ammo. Normally this is linked to the health and ammo cabinets for visualization, however they can function on their own as well. \r\nThis gives the mapper the option to put different models or other alternative sources for health and ammo inside the trigger, for example \"these\":http://magics-territory.com/files/wet/models/models.html crates or a normal wine barrel, from which the player can 'drink' for health.\r\n\r\nI'm asuming that in this case the played sound is also hardcoded? Would it be possible to remove that restriction for the *trigger_heal* and *trigger_ammo* only? No need to change the power-ups.\r\nI'm imagining a new key/value pair that the mapper can specify for those triggers. If it isn't specified, then the game automatically uses the sound it currently is forced to use. But if the mapper sets the key/value pair to e.g. *key:* sound ; *value:* \"sound/[mapname]/health_pickup.wav\", then the game will use the sound in that location.",

This sounds very ugly to me, but it might work.\r\nOr again, a new entry can be added to the list (for 'drink').",

            "notes": "But health and ammo cabinets function differently than power-ups. At first they are the same, since you just place the power-up (for example item_health) the same you place a misc_cabinet_health. The game automatically sets up everything, like model, animations and checks whether the player is already max'ed or if he can pick up more health etc. However cabinets *need a trigger_heal or trigger_ammo* to funciton. They do not funciton on their own. Cabinets don't give you ammo or health. The only thing the cabinet does, is display packs, remove them when it gets told that a pack has been picked up and add them after a certain amount. \r\n\r\nWhat actually gives the player health and ammo are trigger_heal and trigger_ammo. The communication between cabinet and trigger is done because the trigger has a key/value pair with key: target ; value: 'targetname_of_cabinet' and the cabinet has a key/value pair with key: targetname ; value: 'targetname_of_cabinet'. \r\n\r\nThose triggers can be used in combination with a cabinet when they have a target specified, however they can also stand alone. They function the same way as trigger_hurt or any other triggers do. When a player enters a trigger, the trigger starts doing something and when the player leaves the trigger, the triggers stops doing that. When they are linked to other stuff like for example a health_cabinet they communicate to that stuff: \"Hey, I have been activated and I did something, now you do something as well.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActually come to think of it, \"trigger_hurt\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=trigger_hurt has a spawnflag called *SILENT*. This removes the damage sound completely and the mapper can set a speaker to start when a player enters the trigger and and stop when he leaves it. This can be used when the damage source is for example electrical and you want to have a electric sizzling sound, because that barbwire-cut-sound doesn't make sense when you get hurt by electricity.\r\n\r\nSo giving trigger_heal and trigger_ammo a spawnflag *SILENT* would also be an alternative.\r\nHowever, I think that being able to specify the sound a trigger plays, when you activate it would definitely be more efficient. This would be neat for all triggers actually.\r\nSorry for the confusion, I started the ticket badly. I should have called it \"set activation sound for triggers\" or something like that.",

    "description": "It would be nice to be able to set a custom sound for health and ammo pick-ups. Right now all forms of power-ups have a hardcoded sound. *Trigger_heal* have that weird fart sound, *Trigger_ammo* have the same sound as weapon pick-ups and then there are *cold_meal* that have that swallow sound.\r\nIn Dingenskirchen for example, we used different forms of heal and ammo pick-ups in form of the machines and now we also wanted to add another form where the player would get health after 'drinking' from a wine barrel. However we ditched the idea, because we can't set a drinking sound instead of the weird fart noice.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if these power-up entities could receive a key/value pair, where the *key is sound* and the *value is the path* to the sound file. If the key/value pair is not specified the game will pick the standard one.\r\nWould open up possibilities for more creative ways of handling health and ammo in maps.\r\n\r\n==================================\r\nThis functionality is already present with trigger_hurt. Although apparently trigger_heal and trigger_ammo are set up differently in the code it would be nice to have that functionality also with those and other triggers.",
