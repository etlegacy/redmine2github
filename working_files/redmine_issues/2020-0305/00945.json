    "subject": "transition from worldspawn water to script_mover water",
    "description": "So this one is quite a specific bug. You all know the water tunnels in Siwa Oasis. They are filled with simple water brushes set as script_mover to lower or raise them depending on the waterpump. \r\nIn a map of mine I'm using the same setup, however in direct vicinity to worldspawn water brushes. My tunnel system is completely filled with water, however one part of the tunnel is not affected by the water pump and therefore was set as \"worldspawn\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=worldspawn to save entities. The other part that is directly next to it is affected by the water pump and has to be lowered and raised and therefore needs to be a \"script_mover\":http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/entities.php?action=show_entity&entity_name=script_mover. \r\n\r\nThere are two problems and I attached a test map so you can test it yourself.\r\n\r\nFirst bug: Upon transition between worldspawn and script_mover the same sound is played as when the player resurfaces. Inhaling and water splash.\r\nSecond bug: The player animation is bugged in script_mover water *only*. When you enable cg_thirdperson in the test map and then enter the worldspawn water the player animation is fine, but once you enter the script_mover water the player appears to be walking on the ground. This happens no matter from where you enter the script_mover, tested above, sides and from worldspawn and from the other script_mover.\r\n\r\n\r\nTest map - */devmap water_test*\r\n\r\nYellow - wolrdspawn\r\nRed - script_mover 1\r\nBlue - script_mover 2\r\n\r\n",
